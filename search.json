    "text": "Why open science?\nThe Center for Open Science writes that:\n\nAn open exchange of ideas accelerates scientific progress towards solving humanity’s most persistent problems. The challenges of disease, poverty, education, social justice, and the environment are too urgent to waste time on studies lacking rigor, outcomes that are never shared, and findings that are not reproducible.\n\nUnfortunately, climate change adaptation is a field with especially severe problems of reproducibility and replicability (pollack_transparency:2023?). Making our work open and reproducible helps us to ensure that:\n\nour assumptions and modeling choices are transparent and documented, enabling scientific critique and discussion\nour research findings are accessible to the public, including people who aren’t able to afford expensive academic journal subscriptions\nwe can build on our own work in the future.\n\nLots of agencies, including NASA, the White House, the NSF, and many others are placing increasing emphasis on open science. Training group members in open science is a priority for our lab!\n\nDefinitions\nThe ideas of replicability, reproducibility, and open science are closely related.\n\nReproducibility means obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis.\nReplicability means obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data. If an analysis is not reproducible, it’s hard for others to replicate it.\nOpen science is the idea that scientific research should be transparent and accessible to everyone.\n\nSee this National Academies News Release for more details.",

    "text": "Scientific reproducibility\nUnless there are specific and compelling reasons (which should be documented and reviewed by peers), the necessary components of a scholarly work to provide reproducibility should be provided in a publicly accessible location and potentially as part of the scientific record. In the case of a simulation model, this would include things like:\n\na specification of the computing environment\nthe source code that ran the simulation\nthe parameter file or definitions file, and if applicable initial conditions, that ran the simulation\nanalysis code that generated plots for the paper\n\n\nTiming\nWe will make our data and code publicly available no later than with publication of our work, and often earlier.\n\n\nClosed-source tools\nAlthough our preference always is to use fully open-source tools, we occasionally use tools that we have a license to use but to disseminate. In such cases, some additional work is needed.\n\nIf we are using proprietary software, the exact version of the external software should be documented and instructions for how to install it identically should be made clear. Wherever possible, we avoid using proprietary software!\nIf we are using proprietary data, we should make clear the terms of use and how others can obtain the data. We should also make a reproducible example that uses open data to demonstrate the methods. See\n\n\n\nToolkit\nWe use lots of tools to facilitate reproducible science. Although it’s now a few years old Wilson et al. (2017) provides an excellent summary of the tools and practices that can be used to facilitate reproducible science.\nThe specific tools used need to be chosen based on the specific needs of the project. For computing, we often use tools like Python and Julia for programming, and Git or GitHub for version control. We use tools like Snakemake for workflow management. Final datasets and repositories can be published on sites like Zenodo. Preprints can be published on places like Arxiv or EarthArxiv. We try not to be ideological about the specific tools we use, but rather to ensure that the tools we use are appropriate for the task at hand and that we are using them in a way that is consistent with open science principles.\n\n\nSoftware Licenses\nSoftware and other research materials that we make available to the public must declare a license for re-use.\nAll code generated in the lab should be open-source with a permissive (non-copyleft) license (MIT, BSD, or Apache). In some cases, copyleft licenses like the GPL may be appropriate (the key distinction is that these require that derivative works also be open-source).\nIf contributions to upstream copyleft projects are made, those contributions can be licensed in accordance with the upstream project license.\nImportantly, in the lab we should cultivate an atmosphere of respect for licensing terms and ensuring that we are at all times in compliance with those terms. For help choosing a license, see https://choosealicense.com/licenses/ or read Stodden (2009).",

It requires an awareness of the overall state of knowledge in the field, creativity, and plenty of luck.\nDefine the Technical Approach: Software and computing are very important to our group. The PI is working hard to provide a software and hardware environment that enables everyone else to be as productive as possible.\nDepartmental Service: The PI has lots of responsibilities to the department, including attending department meetings, participating in committees, and serving on student masters meetings / qualifying exams / thesis proposals / thesis defenses.\nProvide Scientific Mentoring: It is the PI’s responsibility to help the junior members in the group develop into mature, independent scientists, capable of defining and executing their own research programs. Lab members will meet annually to sketch a strategic plan for the academic year and regularly (for now, weekly) to stay in touch.\nManage the Publication Process: Published papers are the main output of our team. The PI can help identify when results are ready to publish, select which journals to target, and help manage the ups and downs of the revision process.\nObtain Funding: Scientific research is expensive! A central role of the PI is to obtain grant funding to support our work, without which no research could happen.\nProfessional Service: The PI is expected to participate in professional organizations (e.g. AGU, AMS) and review papers and proposals on an ongoing basis.\nProvide Feedback: The PI is expected to provide feedback on all aspects of research, including defining hypotheses and formulating questions; identifying specific methods and technical approaches; identifying relevant datasets; writing and debugging scientific code; producing figures and visualizations; managing data; and writing and editing papers. Feedback is also available on course selection, overall career goals, and long-term strategy.\nProvide Material Support: You are never expected to spend any of your personal finances on anything related to research. All conference travel, computer supplies, books, etc. can be paid for with grant support (see item 2 above). Coordinate these expenses, in advance, with James.\nProvide Moral Support: Graduate school, and research in general, can be an emotional roller coaster. James has been through these challenges personally and is always available to listen and provide advice (though you should also see the Health Resources page).\nProvide Recommendation Letters: You need them for almost every career move.\nSet Goals and Timelines: The PI can help give structure to your project by defining specific milestones and timelines for their completion. Some people prefer to be closely managed in this way, while others may prefer a more hands-off approach.\nSign Stuff: There are lots of signatures needed to navigate the bureaucracy.\nTeach Classes: The PI’s main job is to teach at least one course for semester, which occupies a large fraction of available time and effort.",

Applying to external funding (e.g., NSF GRFP) that you are eligible for is required of our graduate students, but even if it wasn’t, I would recommend it because it is such a valuable learning experience. We maintain a list of funding opportunities on Slack.\nBe Professional and Organized: Develop a system that works for your for managing your responsibilities, coursework, and research. This is one of the biggest challenges of graduate school and there is no formula that works for everyone.\nLead 1:1 Meetings with James. Individual meetings are a time to discuss your research, goals, time management, and any other issues that may be on your mind. It is your job to lead these meetings by sending James an agenda 24 hours in advance, by preparing slides (as needed) for the meeting, and by following up on any action items that are discussed. Do not wait for James to tell you what to do in these meetings – you should be the one driving the conversation.\nDevelop Independence: Your goal is to become an independent scientist. This means you should not hesitate to pursue your own ideas as they arise. Go to as many talks as you can to learn new things! Read (and re-read) papers in your field and outside it. Download that dataset and analyze it! Run that new model! Don’t wait to be told to do things. Take the initiative.\nFocus on your Research: Your research is the most important part of your grad school experience. It should be your main priority, and you should approach it with the seriousness and professionalism you would a full-time job. It is easy to get caught up in coursework or TA-ing, but at the end of 5-ish years, you need to have completed a dissertation.\nStay in Good Standing: it is YOUR responsibility to understand all of the formal requirements of the graduate school and the department, and to stay ahead of all deadlines regarding registration, paperwork, qualifying exams, committee meetings, etc.\nDo Some Soul-Searching: it is your responsibility to think about what type of career you want to pursue (e.g., academic jobs that are research-focused or teaching-focused, non-academic jobs like data science or science writing). We can brainstorm ways of making sure you are getting the training that you need and exposure to paths that you may be interested in.",

See Rice graduate admission guidelines. It is your responsibility to keep track of all required deadlines, materials, etc!\n\nBefore formally applying\nApplying to graduate school is a time- and money-consuming process. You are strongly encouraged (though not required) to reach out before formally applying as this can help to give both of us a sense of whether it’s worth the investment of your time to apply.\nTo reach out, please read the instructions below and then fill out this form. If you send me an email, you will get a template email directing you to fill out the form. I get too many emails from prospective students to keep track of all of them effectively.\n\nDecide if you are interested\n\nRead relevant websites and our papers to judge whether this is a good fit.\nNote the kind of quantitative research we do, the approaches we use, and the problems we analyze.\nFeel free to explore websites of coauthors and close collaborators.\nReview the core values we adopt in the lab group (described int his document) and decide whether they are compatible with your values and goals.\n\nFill out the form” If you are still interested and see the potential for a good fit, fill out the form for prospective applicants.\n\nThis form asks for a statement of purpose. See “how to write a good application” for some helpful tips on how to write a good one! Statements that do not follow these tips are unlikely to stand out and will probably not lead to you being accepted.\nFill out all requested questions thoughtfully. I suggest to draft text inputs in another application so that if your internet connection is disrupted nothing is lost.\nI will follow up via email.\n\nVideo chats\n\nThese are intended to evaluate your verbal communications skills and how well you can articulate your interests. If a video chat does not work for you, we can find alternatives.\nThere is no need for fancy backgrounds, formal presentations, or for dressing up.\nIf this is of joint interest, you should apply formally to the department (see next)\n\n\n\n\nThe formal application\nWhether you have been in touch or not, you must apply to the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice. This will give the department an opportunity to view your transcripts, letters of recommendation, and statement of purpose. Of these, the step you most control is the statement of purpose; see below for tips on information on how to write a strong statement of purpose that enhances your chances of admission.\nAfter formal applications are submitted, I will follow up with information on a formal interview.",

    "text": "FAQ\nAre positions fully funded?\nIn short: yes. All Ph.D. positions within the group will be fully funded. That includes tuition support, a stipend, and other benefits – see Rice’s 2022 Announcement. You will get more details in your formal offer letter if accepted.\nShould I write a research proposal?\nYou should include some research goals and ideas in your statement of purpose, but don’t write a separate research proposal. See the advice listed above for more details.\nHow is it the best way to find a master/Phd opportunity?\nWhen you’re applying to an undergraduate program, you care the most about the university. When applying to a PhD (in engineering at least), you care the most about the research group you will be working with.\nStart by thinking about what kind of research you want to do. Do you like lab work or computational work? What problems do you want to use? What classes do you want to take? Sketch out some research ideas that interest you. Then, conduct a literature review and find out who is working in this space. Look at their web pages and papers and look for research groups that appeal to you.\nHow often do students usually travel for conferences?\nAfter the first year (primarily classes) I aim to fund students to go to the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting (1 week in December) or the American Society of Civil Engineers Environment / Water Resources Institute annual meeting (1 week in May). There are also lots of smaller and more targeted workshops that are often great experiences – they often have some student travel grants and with planning we can often fund student travel.\nWhat are things you wish more students knew before joining your program?\nI got some feedback from current students for this.\n\nBalancing course requirements (roughly 6 courses – see student handbook for details) and research can be a challenge, especially for first-year graduate students who generally have the heaviest courseloads.\nFor anyone doing modeling or data-driven work, most of your day will be spent (i) reading, (ii) writing, or (iii) coding. You should strive to improve your effectiveness in all three areas and plan to spend much of your day at a computer (which also means being deliberate about getting out of your computer!)\nYou will get more out of grad school (this applies to any program!) if you have a clear idea of what you want to learn and what you want to get out of grad school.\n\nWhat is the worst quality of life pain point that your students go through?\nI got some feedback from current students for this.\n\nTrying to learn how to do research while also taking a heavy courseload can make for a tough first semester (this was also my experience).\n\nHow has the lab planned and handled for student’s growth throughout their graduate program?\nI got some feedback from current students for this. We’re still figuring this out and will continue to adapt as we learn more. Students learn best from each other, so we have regular reading groups, where we meet (often with friends from other groups) to discuss papers. We help each other prepare for conferences, give each other feedback on papers, etc. This only works in an environment where we trust each other (both giving and getting feedback require trust) so we need to hold ourselves and each other to a high standard of integrity (i.e., be trustworthy!) As a young / small group, it’s also important to have interaction with people outside the group – we have meetings and social events with other lab groups, and most students are working on collaborative projects that include people from beyond our group.\nHow are publication credits discussed in the lab?\nPlease see authorship guidelines. Journals typically have clear expectations about what constitutes authorship and we follow those guidelines. The most important rule is to have clear conversations about authorship early on (this is the PI’s responsibility but students are always welcome to ask about authorship!)\nHow has the lab dealt with academic and social misconduct situations (plagiarism, bullying, harassment, misogyny, racism, transphobia, etc)?\nSo far we’ve been fortunate to have avoided significant academic and social misconduct. We obviously follow Rice University policies. We’ve also developed a policy on harassment and other expectations that will guide us if (when) these come up. In general we set high expectations for ourselves and for one another because a collaborative and open environment, which benefits everyone, requires mutual trust and respect.",

    "text": "Openings and Applying\nThere are three main ways to do research as an undergraduate:\n\nFor credit\nAs a senior thesis\nFor pay\n\nPlease see the lab website’s “Join Us” page for advertised positions, although you’re always welcome to reach out if you have a specific idea (see below). Specific positions for pay may be also advertised as announcements on the lab website.\n\nResearch for Credit\nIf you want to work in lab and earn course credit, you can sign up for undergraduate research (discuss CEVE 499 with a program administrator or adviser). We will have to fill out a syllabus contract at the beginning of the semester. Typically you would be in lab for at least 10 hours a week, and you would also be required to attend lab meetings, read a few papers, and complete a few short written assignments. You can enroll in undergraduate research multiple times, subject to the requirements of the University and your degree.\nTo Apply: send me an email from your Rice University account:\n\nPut “CEVE 499: Research for Credit” in the subject line of the email,\nAttach your CV or resume (short is fine, undergrads don’t need a 5 page CV!) as a .pdf file\nAttach a 1-2 page project proposal. The more detailed, the better (see below) as a .pdf file\nSuggest some times when you might be available to talk further in the body of the email.\n\n\n\nSenior Thesis Supervision\nIf you are interested in having me supervise your senior thesis project, I recommend doing research for credit course during your sophomore or junior year. However, this is not a strict requirement (especially in 2021 since I’m new here!!)\nTo Apply: as above (to do research for credit) but put “Senior Thesis Supervision” in the subject line of the email.\n\n\nResearch for Pay\nIf you want to work in lab and earn money, there are two different options. The lab can pay you as a research assistant, typically 5-10 hours per week at $12 per hour or as discussed. We have a limited number of hours available each semester, so these positions are competitive. Open positions may be posted on our lab website, but if you have concrete ideas you can propose a project (see below).\nWe can apply for an undergraduate research fellowship to fund your time in lab. Because these fellowships are intended to support your academic development, undergraduate fellows will be required to participate in lab meetings. This option is also available during the summer.\nTo Apply: as above (to do research for credit) but put “Research for Pay” in the subject line of the email.\n\n\nVolunteer Research\nUnpaid internships give an unfair advantage to those who can afford to volunteer their time and contribute to unequal representation in the field. We do not take unpaid volunteers as research assistants in our lab, except for academic credit.",

This document will lay out research questions, research goals, research milestones and timelines, the tools you will need to carry out the research, and the mentoring and guidance you will need. As you write the first draft, your main goal is to convince me that you’ve thought about what research you want to do, that this research serves some intellectual or career goals that you have, that you have most of the skills you will need to do it, and that it’s something that I would be well suited to supervise. Some things that I’m looking for when reading a project proposal are:\n\nIs the research feasible? (Do you have the skills needed? Do I have the resources needed?)\nIs the research interesting? Do you have a sense of previous work in this area? Are there social, policy, or technical implications?\nAre you going to be motivated? Does this advance real goals that you have?\nAm I the right mentor for this work? Do I have the skills and resources needed to support you?\nDoes this research advance my goals?1",

Lab members should typically expect to travel to one major conference per year, subject to funding.\nIf you are interested in attending a conference, please discuss it with James well in advance!\n\nTravel budget\nGrant budgets typically estimate flights plus $200 per day for hotel and meal costs, so your reimbursable costs should be around that amount or less.

This can save money and be more pleasant than staying at a hotel. However, if you don’t feel comfortable in a shared space you are welcome to arrange other accommodation. Your individual safety and comfort in your lodging space should be of chief concern.\n\n\nReimbursement\nYou typically have two choices for travel expenses: you can pay for expenses yourself and seek reimbursement through Rice, or you can ask James to pay for expenses directly using a Rice credit card. In either case, you need to keep all receipts and organize them in a way that makes it easy to submit them for reimbursement.
