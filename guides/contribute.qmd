If there's something you think can be improved, please contribute!

1. Create an account on GitHub if you don't already have one.
1. Create an [issue](https://github.com/dossgollin-lab/lab-guide/issues) on the lab guide repository with a description of the change you'd like to make. If it's vague, we can use this issue for further discussion.

If you're comfortable with git and GitHub, you can also make the change yourself:

1. Fork the repository.
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
1. Open the repository in a text editor (e.g., VS Code) and make the changes you'd like to see.
1. Commit your changes and push them to your fork.
1. Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to merge your changes into the main repository.
