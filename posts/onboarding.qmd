Welcome to the team! We're thrilled to have you join our lab.
To help you get started on the right foot, we've put together this onboarding guide.
Let's walk through the steps together to ensure you have everything you need for a successful start.

## Step 1: Dive into the Lab Guide

Your first task is to familiarize yourself with our lab guide.
This document is your go-to resource for understanding our lab's culture, expectations, and resources.

- Read through the lab guide carefully.
- Schedule a meeting with James to discuss any questions or suggestions you might have.
- This conversation is also a great opportunity to clarify expectations and explore the resources available to you.

Remember, the lab guide is a living document.
Your fresh perspective might bring valuable insights, so don't hesitate to share your thoughts!

## Step 2: Set Up Your Workspace

Getting your work environment right is crucial for productivity and comfort.
Here's what you need to know:

- You don't need to spend your own money on equipment or supplies.
- If you need anything for your computer or workspace, just let James know.
- We want to ensure you have all the tools necessary to do your best work.

## Step 3: Get Connected

Now it's time to plug you into our digital ecosystem.
We'll get you added to:

1. Our GitHub organization for sharing and collaborating on code.
2. Slack for quick chats and project discussions.
3. Zotero for sharing scientific papers and references.
4. Our Google Drive folder for document collaboration.

These platforms will keep you connected with the team and our ongoing projects.
If you're not familiar with any of these tools, don't worry â€“ we're here to help you get up to speed.

## Step 4: Join the Group Website

Last but not least, it's time to make your presence official on our group website!
Here's how:

1. Add a square photo of yourself to the `assets/images/people/` directory.
2. Create an entry in the `people/` directory with your bio and other relevant information.
3. Submit these changes via a Pull Request on GitHub.
