This guide walks you through the process of adding your profile to our lab website at [https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/).

## Understanding the Tools

Before we begin, let's briefly explain the key tools we'll be using:

1. **Git**: A version control system that tracks changes in your code.
2. **GitHub**: A web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and facilitates collaboration. We'll use GitHub's fork and pull request workflow.
For a detailed guide on forking with GitHub, see [GitHub's Forking Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).
3. **Quarto**: An open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. See the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) for more information.
4. **Code Editor**: While you can use any text editor, we recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for its integrated terminal and extensions support.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one.
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (you proably already have it on your computer). You may also want a GUI client like [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop).
3. Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
4. Install a code editor (I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
5. Have a command line interface available (Terminal on macOS/Linux, Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows). On Mac, if you've never done this before, you may need to install Command Line Tools by running `xcode-select --install`.

## Steps to Add Your Profile

### 1. Fork the Repository

Forking creates a copy of the lab website repository under your GitHub account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original project.

1. Go to the [lab website repository](https://github.com/dossgollin-lab/dossgollin-lab.github.io) on GitHub.
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner.
3. Select your personal account as the destination for the fork.

### 2. Clone Your Forked Repository

Cloning downloads the forked repository to your local machine, allowing you to make changes locally.

1. On your forked repository page, click the green "Code" button.
2. Copy the HTTPS URL provided.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to where you want to store the project.
4. Run the following command, replacing `<URL>` with the copied URL:
   ```
   git clone <URL>
   ```

### 3. Set Up the Project

Next, you want to open the project in your text editor so you can make changes.

1. Navigate into the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd dossgollin-lab.github.io
   ```
2. Initialize and update the submodules:
   ```
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
3. Open the folder in VS Code:
   ```
   code .
   ```
4. Install the Quarto extension for VS Code:
   - Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
   - Search for "Quarto".
   - Click "Install" on the Quarto extension.

## Previewing the Website

1. In the terminal within VS Code, ensure you're in the project root directory.
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   quarto preview .
   ```
3. This will open a preview of the website in your default browser.

## Creating Your Profile

1. In VS Code, navigate to the appropriate subfolder within the `people` folder (e.g., `people/grad-students`).
2. Create a new Markdown file with your name (e.g., `john-doe.md`).
3. Use one of the existing profiles as a template.
4. Fill in your details, following this structure:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Full Name"
sortby: "Last Name, First Name"
position: "Your Position" # Optional, for faculty/staff
coadvised: "Coadvised with [Name]" # Optional
started: "Season Year" # eg Fall 2024
ended: "Current" # Or end date if applicable
toc: false
about:
    id: person-profile
    image: "../../_assets/img/people/your-image-file.jpg"
    template: trestles # Choose from options below
    links:
        - icon: envelope
          text: Email
          href: mailto:your.email@rice.edu
        - icon: github
          text: Github
          href: https://github.com/yourusername
        # Add more links if you would like -- see other profiles for examples
format: 
  html:
    page-layout: full

:::{#person-profile}
## Bio

Write your bio here.
Keep each sentence on a separate line.

## Education
- **University Name** | Location<br />Degree, Year
- **Another University** | Location<br />Another Degree, Year
:::
```

5. For the `template` field, choose from: trestles, jolla, solana, marquee, or broadside.
   You can preview these options at [Quarto Website About Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html).

6. Add a square image of yourself to `_assets/img/people/`.
   Update the `image` field in your profile to match the filename.

7. Save your changes and check the preview:
   - If the preview doesn't update automatically, stop the preview process (Ctrl+C in the terminal) and run `quarto preview .` again.
   - Make sure your profile looks good and all information is correct.

## Submitting Your Changes

1. Stage your changes using git (you can use VS Code, the GitHub Desktop app, or the command line):
2. Commit your changes with a clear commit message (e.g., "Add John Doe to grad students").
3. Push the changes to your forked repository:
4. Go to your forked repository on GitHub's website.
5. Click "Contribute" then "Open pull request".
6. Add any necessary comments and create the pull request.

Once your pull request is reviewed and merged, your profile will appear on the lab website.
You can now delete your fork.
