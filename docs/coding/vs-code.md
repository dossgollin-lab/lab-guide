title: VS Code
---

Our text editor of choice is Visual Studio Code, or VS Code for short.
It has lots of extensions and features that make life easy for us.
It's also the preferred editor for [Julia](./julia.md) and has good support for [Python](./python.md) and [LaTeX](./latex.md) as well as other languages we use (stan, C++, yaml, Markdown, etc).
