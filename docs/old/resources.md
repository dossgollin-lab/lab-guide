# Additional Resources

There are lots of other digital resources that may be helpful to group members.
Please add additional resources freely.

## Programming

* Ryan Abernathey's [Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/){:target="_blank"} digital text is the best reference for basic operations on gridded environmental data, using python and UNIX-related tools
* [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/){:target="_blank"} is a great resources for the beginning programmer. Their materials are widely used and form the foundations of lots of other courses.
* The [Water Programming Blog](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"}, managed by Pat Reed's group at Cornell, is a great resource for programming and theory related to genetic algorithms, multi-objective optimization, sensitivity analysis, and more.

## Data Analysis

* Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/){:target="_blank"} is a great way to learn data analysis in **R**, as well as more general model-visualize-improve workflows.
* Michael Betancourt's [blog](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/){:target="_blank"} has accessible, yet extremely rigorous and complex, explanations of key topics around Bayesian modeling, including selection of priors and how Hamiltonian Markov Monte Carlo works.
* [While My MCMC Gently Samples](https://twiecki.io/){:target="_blank"} is another resource with insightful explanations of topics related to Bayesian analysis

## Tools

* [Feedly](https://feedly.com/){:target="_blank"} is a cool aggregator that allows you to subscribe to a wide set of blogs and journals so that you can stay up to date with the latest information
