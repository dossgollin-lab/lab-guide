# Health and well being

Your physical and mental health are crucial to your well being as a person.
These should always take priority over your studies and work.
Conversely, a satisfying and respectful work environment is an important factor in your mental health.

Science can be an emotional roller coaster.
Exams, paper reviews, fellowship applications, and job searches all involve being judged, which often causes anxiety.
There is growing awareness in academia that graduate students are at high risk for depression and anxiety, and that these conditions exist on a continuum.
If you feel you may be facing mental health challenges, don't worry that your problems are too minor or feel ashamed -- you're not alone!

With this in mind, our group strives to do everything possible to support students and ensure a healthy work-life balance.
The vacation and workload expectations defined above are a big part of this.
Don’t overwork!
Some other tips, based on experience, are the following:

1. Maintain a healthy sleep schedule.
2. Pursue interests and hobbies outside of your work. These help relieve stress. They also benefit your research! Stepping away from your problem and letting your mind wander elsewhere is, counterintuitively, a great way to stimulate creative thought.
3. Develop a support network among your peers. They understand the struggle!
