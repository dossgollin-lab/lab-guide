# The `bash` shell

[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) is the default unix shell on Mac OS and most Linux operating systems.
You'll need to use Bash to run many different types of models, and to work on supercomputers or clusters.

## Getting Started

There are a few really good resources out there

* [Ray Toal's Intro](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/bash/){:target="_blank"}

## Key Commands

You should familiarize yourself with the following commands:

* `alias` - create a shortcut for a command
* `awk` - file manipulation; Filtering; Rearranging columns
* `cat` - concatenate files
* `zcat` - concatenate zipped files
* `cd` - change directories
* `curl` - download files
* `echo` - print strings
* `export` - Add a variable to the global environment so that they get passed on to child processes.
* `grep` - filter by pattern
* `egrep` - filter by regex

## Other shells

On your own computer you may choose to use `zsh` instead of `bash`.
`zsh` is like `bash`, but with some few extra features described [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/362409/what-is-zsh-and-why-should-you-use-it-instead-of-bash/){:target="_blank"}.
The [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/){:target="_blank"} extension is highly recommended.
