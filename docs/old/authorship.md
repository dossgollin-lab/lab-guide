# Authorship

Projects that lab members bring with them **do not** automatically confer authorship rights to either James or other lab members.
However, if work is conducted on them during the course of being present in the lab, acknowledgments would be appreciated.
Funding acknowledgments are necessary to describe the source of your funding.

Projects that are collaborated on between lab members do confer authorship, whether that collaboration takes the form of intellectual collaboration, technical collaboration or data sharing.
For instance, writing code to support analysis or simulation would confer authorship.
Sharing information during group meetings does not, although if material intellectual contributions (i.e., new directions, solutions to problems, specific and directed project ideas) are made by lab members, that would confer authorship.

James would **very much** like to be involved in the development of projects that lead to publication, but this is not strictly necessary, and certainly not necessary where lab members are providing supporting roles to external collaborations.
Please keep James apprised of the broad outlines of your external and internal collaborations.

The **first author** of each paper is expected to be proactive about discussing authorship.
At a very early stage in the paper writing process, they should circulate a paper outline including title, authors (in order) and author responsibilities, submission plan, a methods summary, a sketch / cartoon of 1-2 key figures, and key references as footnotes.
This is helpful for avoiding later conflicts over authorship.
The first author is also responsible for editing the document, managing and adding references, and complying with journal submission guides.
