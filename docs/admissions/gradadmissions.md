# Graduate Admissions

If you are unsure whether you would be a good fit, you can send me an email of interest.
Please see below for instructions (if you send me a generic email I probably won't respond!)

## Open Positions

When funding is available for M.S. and Ph.D students to do specific work, these positions will be advertised on the groupâ€™s ["Join"](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/join-the-lab) page.
When projects allow for a broader scope, or more general funding is available, that same page will note how many students the group is looking to take on.
*If you have external funding or a specific research idea, you should reach out (see below) even if there's not a position posted.*

## How to Apply

In order to join the group as a graduate student, you must apply to the program of your choice in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/phd-program).
See [Rice graduate admission guidelines](https://graduate.rice.edu/admissions/how-to-apply).
It is **your responsibility** to keep track of all required deadlines, materials, etc!

### Before formally applying

Applying to graduate school is a time-consuming and money-consuming process.
You are strongly encouraged (though not required) to reach out before formally applying as this can help to give both of us a sense of whether it's worth the investment of your time to apply.

**To reach out, please read the instructions below and then fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/MfcpHnA6E3R2NuSn6).**

1. Read relevant websites and [example papers](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/publications/) to judge whether this is a good fit. Note the kind of quantitative  research we do, the approaches we use, and the problems we analyze. Feel free to explore websites of coauthors and close collaborators.
1. Review the core values we adopt in the lab group (described int his document) and decide whether this is a good fit.
1. If you are still interested and see the potential for a good fit, [**fill out the form for prospective applicants**](https://forms.gle/MfcpHnA6E3R2NuSn6).
    1. Please do not send an email as I cannot keep track of all emails from prospective students.
    1. Please fill out all requested questions thoughtfully. I suggest to draft text inputs in another application so that if your internet connection is disrupted nothing is lost.
    1. I will follow up via email. If this is of joint interest, we move to the next step (video-chats)
1. Video Chats
    1. These are intended to evaluate your verbal communications skills and how well you can articulate your interests. If a video chat does not work for you, we can find alternatives.
    1. There is no need for fancy backgrounds, formal presentations, or for dressing up.
    1. If this is of joint interest, you should apply formally to the department (see next)

### The formal application

Whether you have been in touch or not, you must apply to the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice (see above).
This will give the department an opportunity to view your transcripts, letters of recommendation, and personal statement.

Of these, the step you most control is the personal statement.
A good personal statement should clearly articulate:

1. How would joining this lab group advance your career and life goals?
1. What kind of project would you like to do?
1. How does your current skill-set map to the needs for the project?
1. Is James the right supervisor for you?
1. What synergies do you see with the group?

### After formally applying

If you have already been in touch, James will know to look for your application.
If your application suggests a good potential fit, we'll move on to the next step (guided paper evaluation).

If you have not yet been in touch, be sure to put James as the faculty with whom you want to work.
You may be invited to a brief video chat (see above) before proceeding to the guided paper evaluation.

1. **Formal Interview:** there are two steps to the formal interview
    1. Written paper evaluation
        1. James will send you an email asking you to provide a written evaluation of a paper, which he will provide in that email. This paper will be selected based on your discussed interests. The goal of this response is to get a sense of your reading, writing, and critical thinking skills.
        1. Limit the evaluation to one page (12 point font) and address these questions:
            1. What are the main research questions and hypotheses of the paper?
            1. What are the key results?
            1. What are (potential) caveats?
            1. How would you improve on the paper?
        1. This evaluation is governed by the [Rice Honor Policy](https://honor.rice.edu/frequently-asked-questions/). Please briefly review this document and include the pledge("On my honor, I have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid on this assignment").
            1. You should do this work on your own, without communicating with advisors, colleagues, etc.
            1. You may use information on the web -- not only bibliographic search tools but also Wikipedia, PubPeer, Hypothesis, etc. However, you must attribute your sources.
            1. Please use a formal bibliogrpahic style such as APA, AGU, or similar for citing scholarly works. You may reference web sites and other materials using endnotes. References do not count toward the 1 page limit.
        1. Please return your paper evaluation within seven days (if you think this will be a constraint, communicate this ahead of time and we can give additional time)
    1. Video interview
        1. The purpose of this interview is to get a sense of your communication skills. If you have done research before, then you should prepare a 12 minute presentation about your work. If not, you do not need to prepare anything. James will ask you questions about your research, the paper you evaluated, and more general questions.
1. **Meet the group:** If your interview suggests you would be a good fit for our group, we will move to the next step: meet the lab group.
    1. This visit may be in-person or remotely, depending on travel logistics
    1. Please prepare a short presentation for the group about a research idea. This should cover *research you want to do*, not research you have already done.
    1. Feel free to reach out to other lab-group members or collaborators to ask questions
1. **Join the group:** If this step suggests a good fit and we can work out the logistics, we move to the last step (you joining the lab group)
    1. You join the lab group and we start the work!

## How we evaluate your application

There are two main questions that your application needs to answer.
Fundamentally, they're about making sure that if you join this group to do a Ph.D. at Rice, you will be happy and successful.
Ph.D. students who are happy and successful are PhD students in a program that is a good fit for their skills and interests!

### Advancing your goals

The first question your application needs to address is whether doing a Ph.D. with us advance *your* life/career goals?
A PhD can be a long and tiring process.
Happy and successful PhD students are those who can draw energy and support from the big picture.
In your application, I'm looking to see:
    1. Have you thought clearly about your long-term goals? This doesn't have to be specific ("I want to work at a particular national lab") and you can express uncertainty ("I am interested in developing a startup and in academia, and this PhD will prepare me for both while helping me decide"). You should, of course, be interested in a career that involves research! I'm more interested in seeing evidence of a thoughtful process of discernment than in what your specific goals are. There isn't a "right" answer.
    1. Will the research projects I'm working on help you advance those goals? If your goal is to be an astronaut, this probably isn't a good fit.
    1. Out of all the many potential advisors, why am I the right supervisor for you to carry out this research?

### Background

Do you have the required training and ability to carry out this research?
Have you given clear thought to the skills you will need to acquire and do you have a plan for how you will obtain them?
PhD students aren't expected to hit the ground running -- some coursework and training is necessary -- but having a strong background will help you transition quickly to interesting research projects and minimize frustrations.
Strong applicants will have some exposure to the following skills, and will excel in at least one area (no one knows everything, though).

In alphabetical order:

1. *Bigger picture:* Climate change and critical infrastructure affect real people. However, we can't model everything -- we need to focus on a subset of the problem. At the same time, analytical tools have at times been used to oppress and silence marginalized groups. Are you able to think about how your research fits into broader research and policy questions, and what implications might be for real people in the real world?
1. *Critical thinking:* A Ph.D. is a license to do independent research, which means you should be able to formulate and examine research questions, not just turn the crank. You should be able to tell a story about why you posed a particular question, how your prior understanding of the area led you to formulate certain hypotheses, how you designed your experiment to test those hypotheses, and what the implications of the results are for your hypotheses in particular and the field in general. This skill is hard to demonstrate, but you can show your abilities in your personal statement and in any subsequent interviews.
1. *Physical sciences:* Understanding climate risk and how it might change in the future requires some basic understanding of physical processes. A background in earth science, environmental science, environmental engineering, physics, hydrology, or similar fields will help you examine present and future hydroclimate hazard.
1. *Programming:* All the work we do involves computation and simulation. In our group we use mainly Python, R, and Julia, but experience in other languages will serve you well. If you've never programmed, consider taking a free online class to demystify coding and to make sure that you will be happy spending hours every day writing and editing code.
1. *Statistics, applied mathematics, and optimization:* We use quantitative tools to characterize uncertainty and inform decisions. If you have a solid background in probability or statistics, it will help you hit the ground running. Coursework or skills in statistics, probability, econometrics, optimization, applied mathematics, water resources management, and similar fields will strengthen your application.
1. *Writing and communication:* Science requires a great deal of reading, writing, and presenting. Clear communication is a critical skill, especially in the age of information overload. This doesn't mean that if English is your second language you can't thrive. However, you should use your personal statement (and share work you've finished) to demonstrate your writing abilities.

If you are interested in our work but aren't sure whether you have a strong background, please reach out! (In particular, studies show that *individuals from minoritized groups tend to underestimate their own abilities.* Please don't sell yourself short!)

### Other advice

Although your application is assessed holistically, you should focus on crafting the personal statement to make sure that it clearly and obviously answers all three of these questions.

## FAQ

### Should I write a research proposal?

You should include some research goals and ideas in your personal statement, but don't write a separate research proposal.
It's better to have a very strong personal statement than a less strong personal statement plus a research proposal.

### How is it the best way to find a master/Phd opportunity?

When you're applying to an undergraduate program, you care the most about the university.
When applying to a PhD (in engineering at least), you care the most about the research group you will be working with.

Start by thinking about what kind of research you want to do.
Do you like lab work or computational work?
What problems do you want to use?
What classes do you want to take?
Sketch out some research ideas that interest you.
Then, conduct a literature review and find out who is working in this space.
Look at their web pages and papers and look for research groups that appeal to you.

### What are normally the deadlines of the applications?

In general, programs in the US have a deadline in December or January for admission to the fall semester.
Some programs have a deadline in the fall for admission to the spring semester.
See [Rice graduate admission guidelines](https://graduate.rice.edu/admissions/how-to-apply) for our program's deadlines.

### What are things you wish more students knew before joining your program?

*I got some feedback from current students for this.*

1. Balancing course requirements (roughly 6 courses -- see student handbook for details) and research can be a challenge, especially for first-year graduate students who generally have the heaviest courseloads.
1. For anyone doing modeling or data-driven work, most of your day will be spent (i) reading, (ii) writing, or (iii) coding. You should strive to improve your effectiveness in all three areas and plan to spend much of your day at a computer (which also means being deliberate about getting out of your computer!)
1. You will get more out of grad school (this applies to any program!) if you have a clear idea of what you want to learn and what you want to get out of grad school.

### What is the worst quality of life pain point that your students go through?

*I got some feedback from current students for this.*

1. Trying to learn how to do research while also taking a heavy courseload can make for a tough first semester (this was also my experience).

### How has the lab planned and handled for student's growth throughout their graduate program?

*I got some feedback from current students for this.*
We're still figuring this out and will continue to adapt as we learn more.
Students learn best from each other, so we have regular reading groups, where we meet (often with friends from other groups) to discuss papers.
We help each other prepare for conferences, give each other feedback on papers, etc.
This only works in an environment where we trust each other (both giving and getting feedback require trust) so we need to hold ourselves and each other to a high standard of integrity (i.e., be trustworthy!)
As a young / small group, it's also important to have interaction with people outside the group -- we have meetings and social events with other lab groups, and most students are working on collaborative projects that include people from beyond our group.

### How are publication credits discussed in the lab?

Please see [`authorship`](../policies/authorship.md).
Journals typically have clear expectations about what constitutes authorship and we follow those guidelines.
The most important rule is to have clear conversations about authorship early on (this is the PI's responsibility but students are always welcome to ask about authorship!)

### How has the lab dealt with academic and social misconduct situations (plagiarism, bullying, harassment, misogyny, racism, transphobia, etc)?

So far we've been fortunate to have avoided significant academic and social misconduct.
We obviously follow Rice University policies.
We've also developed a [policy on harassment](../expectations/harassment.md) and other expectations that will guide us if (when) these come up.
In general we set high expectations for ourselves and for one another because a collaborative and open environment, which benefits everyone, requires mutual trust and respect.
