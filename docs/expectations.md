# Expectations

All members of the research group are required to agree with the [code of conduct](/conduct/).

## Data Sharing

We may develop specific data sharing plans for future projects.

## Authorship

Projects that lab members bring with them **do not** automatically confer authorship rights to either James or other lab members.
However, if work is conducted on them during the course of being present in the lab, acknowledgments would be appreciated.
Funding acknowledgments are necessary to describe the source of your funding.

Projects that are collaborated on between lab members do confer authorship, whether that collaboration takes the form of intellectual collaboration, technical collaboration or data sharing.
For instance, writing code to support analysis or simulation would confer authorship.
Sharing information during group meetings does not, although if material intellectual contributions (i.e., new directions, solutions to problems, specific and directed project ideas) are made by lab members, that would confer authorship.

James would **very much** like to be involved in the development of projects that lead to publication, but this is not strictly necessary, and certainly not necessary where lab members are providing supporting roles to external collaborations.
Please keep James apprised of the broad outlines of your external and internal collaborations.

The **first author** of each paper is expected to be proactive about discussing authorship.
At a very early stage in the paper writing process, they should circulate a paper outline including title, authors (in order) and author responsibilities, submission plan, a methods summary, a sketch / cartoon of 1-2 key figures, and key references as footnotes.
This is helpful for avoiding later conflicts over authorship.
The first author is also responsible for editing the document, managing and adding references, and complying with journal submission guides.

## Lab presence and roles

`NOTE: Human resources guidelines take precedence over this section.`

We work on issues of critical societal importance, and it is expected that  lab members will work with a degree of seriousness commensurate with these challenges.
Working hard means:

* applying consistent, focused effort to your research in a serious, professional way
* working with a sense of urgency appropriate to the intellectual challenges we study and their real-world consequences
* [caring](/expectations/health/) for your physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional well-being
* sharing ideas and effort with lab members and collaborators

Working hard **does not mean**:

* putting in unreasonable or unsustainable hours
* competing to work the hardest or contributing to burnout culture

### Being present

One of the great advantages of working in academia is the flexible schedule.
But this flexibility can also be a curse.
Here are some general guidelines to help define what it means to be "at work":

1. Aim for a 40 hour work-week on average. Academic work often occurs in bursts. Sometimes you are happy and excited to work an 80 hour week as you are on the cusp of a major breakthrough. You can balance these periods of intensity with slower-paced weeks at another time.
2. Generally plan to be at Lamont for most of the day on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. These are when seminars and group meetings tend to be held. Being present in the office is important for building relationships with you colleagues and for the spontaneous generation of new ideas.
3. Be available on communication channels all business days (Monday - Friday) during business hours (9am - 5pm).
4. Feel free to work remotely occasionally as it suits your personal and professional life. For example, if your family lives abroad, you may wish to spend a week or two working from their country. This should be the exception, not the rule.
5. Be clear about when you are really on vacation, as opposed to working remotely. Don't ruin your recuperation by pretending to work.
6. Students and postdocs should take 4 weeks of vacation per year.
7. Travel dates for vacation and non-vacation remote work must be approved by James. These requests should be made via email at least one month before any planned travel.

Lab members are encouraged to participate in departmental activities as well as activities in other departments on campus (Kinder Institute, Data Science, Earth Science, Baker Institute, etc.).

## Roles and responsibilities

### PI responsibilities

As the group leader, James has a unique and challenging range of responsibilities.

1. **Define the Overall Research Directions for the Group:** Identifying the important problems is one of the hardest and most crucial aspects of scientific research. It requires an awareness of the overall state of knowledge in the field, plus creativity and plenty of luck.
2. **Obtain Funding:** Scientific research is expensive! A central role of the PI is to obtain grant funding to support our work, without which no research could happen.
3. **Provide Scientific Mentoring:** It is the PI’s responsibility to help the junior members in the group develop into mature, independent scientists, capable of defining and executing their own research programs.
4. **Set Goals and Timelines:** The PI can help give structure to your project by defining specific milestones and timelines for their completion. Some people prefer to be closely managed in this way, while others may prefer a more hands-off approach.
5. **Provide Feedback:** The PI is expected to provide feedback on all aspects of research, including defining hypotheses and formulating questions; identifying specific methods and technical approaches; identifying relevant datasets; writing and debugging scientific code; producing figures and visualizations; managing data; and writing and editing papers. Feedback is also available on course selection, overall career goals, and long-term strategy. As a 
6. **Oversee the Publication Process:** Published paper are the main output of our team. The PI can help identify when results are ready to publish, select which journals to target, and help manage the ups and downs of the revision process.
7. **Define the Technical Approach:** Software and computing are very important to our group. The PI is working hard to provide a software and hardware environment that enables everyone else to be as productive as possible.
8. **Provide Moral Support:** Graduate school, and research in general, can be an emotional roller coaster. James has been through these challenges personally and is always available to listen and provide advice.
9. **Provide Material Support:** You are never expected to spend any of your personal finances on anything related to research. All conference travel, computer supplies, books, etc. etc. can be paid for with grant support (see item 2 above). These expenses should be coordinated via the PI.
10. **Provide Recommendation Letters:** You need them for almost every career move.
11. **Sign Stuff:** There are lots of signatures needed to navigate the bureaucracy.
12. **Departmental Service:** The PI has lots of responsibilities to the department, including attending department meetings, participating in committees, and serving on student masters meetings / qualifying exams / thesis proposals / thesis defenses.
13. **Community Service:** The PI is expected to participate in professional organizations (e.g. AGU, AMS) and review papers and proposals on an ongoing basis.
14. **Teach Classes:** Oh yeah, as a professor, the PI’s main job is to teach at least one course for semester, which occupies a large fraction of available time and effort.
15. **Do Personal Research:** On top of the above, believe it or not, the PI still has his own personal research projects which he occasionally attempts to find time to work on.

One point of enumerating these responsibilities is to emphasize that the PI has a great many demands on his time, which must be managed carefully.

### Grad Student Responsibilities

Grad students have a complex range of responsibilities to manage.
Learning to deal with it all is part of the journey of graduate school.

1. **Stay in Good Standing:** it is YOUR responsibility to understand all of the formal requirements of the graduate school and the department, and to stay ahead of all deadlines regarding registration, paperwork, qualifying exams, committee meetings, etc. The DEES Guide to the PhD Program is an essential reference in this regard.
2. **Be Professional and Organized:** Develop a system that works for your for managing your responsibilities, coursework, and research. This is one of the biggest challenges of graduate school. Unfortunately there is no formula that works for everyone.
3. **Stay on Top of your Coursework:** The beginning of grad school is dominated by classes. You should strive to get as much as possible out of your coursework and connect it to your research wherever possible.
4. **Develop Independence:** Your goal is to become an independent scientist. This means you should not hesitate to pursue your own ideas as they arise. Go to as many talks as you can to learn new things! Read (and re-read) papers in your field and outside it. Download that dataset and analyze it! Run that new model! Don’t wait to be told to do things. Take the initiative.
5. **Focus on your Research:** Your research is the most important part of your grad school experience. It should be your main priority, and you should approach it with the seriousness and professionalism you would a full-time job.
6. **Develop a Research Plan:** In consultation with your advisor, you should come up with a long-term plan for your research, with clearly defined milestones and goals. Each week, you should have a short term plan for exactly what to work on to move towards those goals.
7. **Produce Reusable Data / Software:** In our group, we believe strongly that research is more than just papers. You are expected to share the outputs of your research (data and software) in a way that makes them reusable by the rest of the group and the rest of the field.
8. **Ask Questions!** If something is unclear to you–either a science question or a procedural / administrative issue–it is your responsibility to speak up.
9. **Communicate** with the Group and attend group meetings.

### Undergraduate Responsibilities

Undergraduate students in the research group have a few core responsibilities.

1. Learn
2. Participate
3. Meet college requirements
4. Maintain average working rate of 10hrs/wk
5. Plan for the future
6. Explore many paths
7. Submit weekly reports
8. Attend lab meetings when possible
9. Apply for scholarships, awards, and fellowships

## Open science

Unless there is a *very* good reason ([PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information) or other restrictions, for instance), work should be conducted in public repositories on publicly accessible servers such as bitbucket.
This includes software.
Paper repositories should be open, but may be held back as private until time of either first submission to a journal, a preprint server, *or* a non-author for review.
Because it is expected that repositories will be made publicly accessible, including history of changesets, lab members are encouraged to behave professionally in them.

> **Note:** Many professional societies consider the content of referee reports to be *de facto* confidential.  As such, unless the report is explicitly open, it should not be added to repositories as text, commit messages, or comments in papers.

Grant proposals developed internally with no external PIs or Co-PIs should be made available unless there is confidential information.
Grant proposals developed in collaboration with external PIs or Co-PIs may be kept confidential at the external collaborators discretion, although our preference is for them to be open.

### Reproducibility

Unless strongly prohibited by external concerns, the necessary components of a scholarly work to provide reproducibility should be provided in a publicly accessible location and potentially as part of the scientific record.
In the case of an astrophysical simulation paper, this would include:

 * The source code that ran the simulation (shorthand would be the hash of the publicly available source)
 * The parameter file or definitions file, and if applicable initial conditions, that ran the simulation.
 * Analysis code that generated plots from the paper.

The overall theme here is that of reproducibility; this is not the same as bitwise identical reproduction, which is often unavailable because of constraints such as order-of-arrival differences.
The additional overhead of making work reproducible should not be onerous compared to the other expectations, and in many ways (i.e., turnkey plot generation, good note taking on data, etc) can reduce the overall effort of developing papers and workflows.

### Ethics

Note: this is distinct from the code of conduct for the lab, which applies both within and without the lab.

Our actions should be guided by the ethics of participating in the scientific community.
This includes prioritizing our professional obligations over fear of being "scooped."
For instance, it is *completely unacceptable* to interfere with the peer review process for a paper out of concern of protecting one's own work (i.e., "sitting" on a review for it, making unreasonable requests to delay publication, and so on.)

When competitors request assistance with software developed in the lab, we should attempt to make a best effort to assist them. 
It is not unreasonable to ask for authorship, particularly if the collaboration is extensive.

When authoring papers, we should be providing citations to all software that assisted in the development of the scholarly work.
While in the extreme case this would extend to the operating system level, in general it is acceptable to cite the layers of software in the analysis stack (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib, IPython/Jupyter, etc.)
It is preferred to directly cite the canonical papers (often described in `CITATION.txt` files) for software, but acknowledging them without citation may be sufficient.

Citations to data DOIs or publications should be made wherever possible, and where not possible, should be included as footnotes.

When developing software, we must make a best effort to cite which pieces of software contributed to the development.

Plagarism is unacceptable in any form. 
This includes "first pass" text included in papers or proposals; when "first pass" text is included from an external source, it must be clearly marked as such to ensure it is not accidentally included in the final product.
