# About

This section contains short description of the key tools we're using.
Each entry contains information on why we use this tool, how it works, and how to learn more.

Although there is value in having all group members use the same toolkit, this isn't intended to be restrictive -- you are **always** free to experiment and try new tools.
If something works well, teach it to others and add it to this document.
The tools here are simply intended to be starting points.
