# R

R is a statistical programming language.
Although in general we prefer python, stable versions of some statistical models are implemented only in R.
R also has great tools for working with tabular data.

Although R is a great language -- and in fact, it's the best overall tool for a lot of use cases -- there's not a lot that you can do in R but not Python or Julia.
That means that developing infrastructure in R is generally not a good use of our time.

However, R is widely used in some communities -- including corners of the stats community -- so you may end up using it for a collaboration.
Alternatively, you may find that there's some model you want to run that's already implemented smoothly in R.
In that case, don't reinvent the wheel!
