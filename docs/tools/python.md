# Python

python is our programming language of choice.
Python is a multi-purpose language with stable and high-performing libraries for numerical computing, data visualization, gridded data, machine learning, and more.

## Usage

* Install packages with `conda` and specify `environment.yml` files that list required packages for all code

### Additional tools

* The [black](https://github.com/psf/black){:target="_blank"} formatter keeps code pretty
* The [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/){:target="_blank"} linter and static [type hinting](https://sunscrapers.com/blog/python-best-practices-static-typing-in-python-with-mypy/){:target="_blank"} clarify expected inputs and outputs
