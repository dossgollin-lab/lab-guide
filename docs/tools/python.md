# Python

Python is a general purpose programming language with stable and high-performinglibraries for numerical computing, data visualization, gridded data, machine learning, and optimization.

## Installation

You should install Python (version 3.6 or greater -- not version 2) using [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
This provides you with the `conda` package manager, which you can use to create Python "environments" on your computer.


## Getting started

Read the [Chapter in Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/lectures/core_python/python_fundamentals.html){:target="_blank"}

## Usage

* Install packages with `conda` and specify `environment.yml` files that list required packages for all code

### Additional tools

* The [black](https://github.com/psf/black){:target="_blank"} formatter keeps code pretty
* The [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/){:target="_blank"} linter and static [type hinting](https://sunscrapers.com/blog/python-best-practices-static-typing-in-python-with-mypy/){:target="_blank"} clarify expected inputs and outputs


### Digging Deeper

* to write better code, watch Raymond Hettinger's 2015 PyCon talk [Beyond PEP 8 -- Best practices for beautiful intelligible code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M&list=LL&index=20&t=0s)
* to understand object oriented programming, type hints, scripting, and `mypy` watch [Livecoding Madness - Let's Build a Deep Learning Library](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o64FV-ez6Gw) and [I don't like notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U) by Joel Grus
* to learn about unit testing, work through the short course [Software Testing and Testing Automation with Python](https://leemangeophysicalllc.github.io/testing-with-python/) by Leeman Geophysical LLC
