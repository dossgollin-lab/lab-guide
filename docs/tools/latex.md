## VS Code

Use the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension for best results.
Optionally, [LaTeX Utilities](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tecosaur.latex-utilities) provides some useful functionality like word count (although it's no longer actively maintained -- use with caution).
