## Plan of Attack

1. Explore, think, read, talk
2. Create a draft version on Google Docs
     * Brainstorm
     * Outline
     * Write short version: title, authors (in order) and author responsibilities, submission plan, short methods, sketch / cartoon of 1-2 key figures, references as footnotes
3. Create results
4. (Iterate as needed)
5. Write final version in [LaTeX](/latex)
      * References, formatting, etc. are responsibility of first author
      * James will create a document using the lab's [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) account and add collaborators
      * Save important milestones as versions
      * Using `git` and `GitHub`, you can download the document and work remotely. In this case, you are responsible for any merge conflicts!
