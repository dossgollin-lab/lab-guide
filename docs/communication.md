# Communication

## Group Web Site

We have a web site, stored on GitHub.
Senior graduate students are expected to post (short!) blog posts when you do things of note, as well as to update project information on that page.
All updates are conducted either via pull request or direct git commits.

Also, you should add yourself to the page by editing `_data/people.yaml` and adding a **square** photo to `people/`!

## Venues

We use a few communication mechanisms that meet several different categories of need: ephemeral, archived, immediate, and asynchronous.

* Slack: We utilize a slack team. You should receive an invite when you join the group. All internal communications should go here.
* There is a shared Google calendar that you can be invited to. Please post your travel dates, interesting conferences, and so on on this. Lab visitors will be listed there as well.
* We aim to have weekly group meetings. These group meetings include a general discussion of anything that needs to be talked about (announcements, particularly interesting papers, etc) and then an around-the-table of updates. These can include things you’ve worked on, things you’ve learned about, struggles you’re having, and so on.
* Group members are expected to schedule weekly meetings with James!
* Email: sometimes email is the best way to share critical updates or to communicate with people outside the group.

## Social Media Policy

In general, unless there are embargoes or restrictions on a particular project, social media can be freely used.
However, lab members are encouraged to be respectful and kind while participating if they are representing themselves as lab members.
The [Code of conduct](/conduct/) does apply online.
