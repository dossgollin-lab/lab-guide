## Core values

* **Academic freedom:** The comparative advantage of academia is the freedom to question the status quo, explore new ideas, and develop novel approaches.
* **Diversity:** A diversity of many voices is essential, not only for the long-term strength of the scholarly community, but also to improve the quality and rigor of our work.
* **Humility:** We work on issues of interest to our community, and we don't know all the answers. We understand the limitations of our expertise and respect that knowledge is "co-produced" with a wide range of stakeholders.
* **Open science:** Data, code and other digital research objects should be shared whenever possible, in ways that enable reuse and discovery.
