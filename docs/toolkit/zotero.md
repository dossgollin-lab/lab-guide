# Zotero

If you're going to read scientific papers and manage references, you should use a modern reference manager.
Zotero stands out because it is open access, freely available with [unlimited](https://library.rice.edu/news/new-subscription-unlimited-file-syncing-storage-rice-zotero-users) through Fondren library, extensible through a range of plugins, and lets you annotate using your PDF reader of choice.
Group members should use Zotero to access our group's shared resources.

* Fondren library has [resources](https://fondrenlearning.blogs.rice.edu/zotero/) for Zotero training
* You can add a bookmark to your browser. When you are visiting a journal web site, you can click this button and it will route the page through Rice Library's website. See [here](https://paperpile.com/p/proxy-rice/) for details. If you have Zotero connector installed in your browser, it can remember these settings and automatically proxy that website in the future.
* Though a full mobile app is under development, [Papership](https://www.papershipapp.com/) provides a free Zotero reader for your mobile device

* [Better BibTex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/) provides manual and automated export to bibtex
