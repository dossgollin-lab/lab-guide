# Funding

!!! info "Credit"
    Specific language on this page comes from the [Aly Lab](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual/){:target="_blank"} at Columbia University

At some point, you will likely be asked to provide a figure or two for a grant James's writing, and/or provide feedback on the grant.
By the same token, you are entitled to read any grant James has submitted, whether it is ultimately funded or not.
Aside from being a good opportunity to learn how grants are written, this will also allow you to see her vision for the lab in the years ahead.
Feel free to ask James to see any of his grants.
