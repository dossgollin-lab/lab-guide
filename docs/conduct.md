# Participation Guide

This is an evolving guide on how to participate in our research group.
This document borrows heavily from similar efforts by colleagues such as [Ryan Abernathey](https://ocean-transport.github.io/guide.html) and [Katy Huff](http://arfc.npre.illinois.edu/manual/).


## Core Principles

1.  Respect others: abide by the code of conduct.
2.  Work hard: we are all here because we are passionate about science and want to make a big impact on our field. This requires working with a sense of urgency.
3.  Communicate with the group: participate in group events, be present at the office, and be available via communication channels.
4.  Take care of yourself: your physical and mental health is paramount.

These principles are explained in more specific detail below.

## Respect Others: Code of Conduct

All Rice university employees and students must understand and comply with the University’s policies and procedures regarding harassment and discrimination.
James is a mandatory reporter and will report any incidents of harassment or misconduct that violate these policies.
In addition to these formal procedures, our group adopts additional informal guidelines on conduct which may go beyond the University’s policies.

Our group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or political views.
We do not tolerate harassment in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any professional context, including group meetings, individual meetings, conferences, online communications, and work-related social events.
Anyone violating these rules may be temporarily suspended or permanently expelled from the group, at the discretion of the group leader James Doss-Gollin.

Respect for others goes beyond simply "don't harass".
Respect requires creating an environment where people of all backgrounds and personalities feel comfortable and welcome in scientific discussions. 
This means being conscious of how we talk to each other and leaving space in conversations for everyone's voice.
Interrupting, talking over others, and aggressively dominating a conversation are unacceptable behaviors.
For the men in the group, this generally means listening more, talking less, and hesitating before we interject with our opinion.

## Work Hard: Roles and Expectations

Working hard means applying consistent, focused effort to your research in a serious, professional way.
It means working with a sense of urgency appropriate to the intellectual challenges we study and their real-world consequences.
It does not mean putting in unreasonable or unsustainable hours; rather, it means taking thoughtful and responsible steps to avoid unhappiness and burn-out.
Below we enumerate specific responsibilities and expectations for different roles within the group.


### PI Responsibilities

As the group leader, James has a unique and challenging range of responsibilities.

1. **Define the Overall Research Directions for the Group:** Identifying the important problems is one of the hardest and most crucial aspects of scientific research. It requires an awareness of the overall state of knowledge in the field, plus creativity and plenty of luck.
2. **Obtain Funding:** Scientific research is expensive! A central role of the PI is to obtain grant funding to support our work, without which no research could happen.
3. **Provide Scientific Mentoring:** It is the PI’s responsibility to help the junior members in the group develop into mature, independent scientists, capable of defining and executing their own research programs.
4. **Set Goals and Timelines:** The PI can help give structure to your project by defining specific milestones and timelines for their completion. Some people prefer to be closely managed in this way, while others may prefer a more hands-off approach.
5. **Provide Feedback:** The PI is expected to provide feedback on all aspects of research, including defining hypotheses and formulating questions; identifying specific methods and technical approaches; identifying relevant datasets; writing and debugging scientific code; producing figures and visualizations; managing data; and writing and editing papers. Feedback is also available on course selection, overall career goals, and long-term strategy. As a 
6. **Oversee the Publication Process:** Published paper are the main output of our team. The PI can help identify when results are ready to publish, select which journals to target, and help manage the ups and downs of the revision process.
7. **Define the Technical Approach:** Software and computing are very important to our group. The PI is working hard to provide a software and hardware environment that enables everyone else to be as productive as possible.
8. **Provide Moral Support:** Graduate school, and research in general, can be an emotional roller coaster. Ryan has been through these challenges personally and is always available to listen and provide advice.
9. **Provide Material Support:** You are never expected to spend any of your personal finances on anything related to research. All conference travel, computer supplies, books, etc. etc. can be paid for with grant support (see item 2 above). These expenses should be coordinated via the PI.
10. **Provide Recommendation Letters:** You need them for almost every career move.
11. **Sign Stuff:** There are lots of signatures needed to navigate the bureaucracy.
12. **Departmental Service:** The PI has lots of responsibilities to the department, including attending department meetings, participating in committees, and serving on student masters meetings / qualifying exams / thesis proposals / thesis defenses.
13. **Community Service:** The PI is expected to participate in professional organizations (e.g. AGU, AMS) and review papers and proposals on an ongoing basis.
14. **Teach Classes:** Oh yeah, as a professor, the PI’s main job is to teach at least one course for semester, which occupies a large fraction of available time and effort.
15. **Do Personal Research:** On top of the above, believe it or not, the PI still has his own personal research projects which he occasionally attempts to find time to work on.

One point of enumerating these responsibilities is to emphasize that the PI has a great many demands on his time, which must be managed carefully.
