## Mission Statement

Our mission is to support the social, environmental, and financial resilience of communities around the world by creatively informing the design and management of infrastructure systems.
Through mission-oriented basic research guided by community engagement, we develop tools and methods to accurately, transparently, and collaboratively link decisions, outcomes, and preferences.

## Core values

* **Academic freedom:** As academics, we enjoy the privileged space to question the status quo, imagine new possibilities, and develop novel approaches.
* **Equity:** Our work informs decisions that affect the real lives of real people, and  we value every individual's unique preferences. We recognize the uncomfortable reality of systemic oppression and seek to promote fairness, impartiality, and justice through our work.
* **Excellence:** We strive for excellence in all our activities and aim to be role models in all that we do. We seek to do what is right, not what is easy.
* **Humility:** We understand the limitations of our expertise and celebrate the academic and community partners with whom we co-produce knowledge. We mitigate our limitations by actively seeking out diverse perspectives and challenging our preexisting assumptions.
* **Open Science:** We seek to make our research accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional.

## Contents

The rest of this document provides some guidance for how we incorporate these values into our daily work.

* Our [Harassment Policy](harassment) holds us to a basic standard of mutual respect when interacting with one another.

* The [New Member Checklist](checklist) will get our new members up to speed. Welcome!
* Our [Open Science](open) vision describes how we implement reproducible and accessible research, and how we clearly communicate findings (which are always imperfect) to peers and to the public.
* [Roles and Responsibilities](expectations) describes what your responsibilities are as a lab member -- and what they are not.
* Our [Writing Papers](papers) guide outlines our policies on writing papers, particularly authorship.
