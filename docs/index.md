# Welcome to the Doss-Gollin Group Lab Guide

This document (1) describes our group's core policies and procedures and (2) offers guidance on learning and using key tools.

Our group policies are informal guidelines and should never supersede your common sense, University policies, or the law.

The description of tools used in the group is intended to help new members get started.
All group members should be familiar with these tools, but are free to use other tools as appropriate.
