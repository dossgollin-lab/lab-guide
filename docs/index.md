## Mission Statement

Our mission is to support the social, environmental, and financial resilience of communities around the world by creatively informing the design and management of infrastructure systems.
Through mission-oriented basic research guided by community engagement, we develop tools and methods to accurately, transparently, and collaboratively link decisions, outcomes, and preferences.

## Core values

!!! success "Creativity"
    As academics, we enjoy the luxuries of freedom and space that allow us to question the status quo and explore new ideas.
    With this privilege comes a responsibility to imagine new possibilities and speak uncomfortable truths.

!!! success "Equity"
    We recognize the burdens of systemic inequality and seek to promote fairness, impartiality, and justice.

!!! success "Excellence"
    We strive for excellence in all our activities and aim to be role models in all that we do.
    We seek to do what is right, not what is easy, and acknowledge when we fall short.

!!! success "Humility"
    We understand the limitations of our expertise and celebrate the academic and community partners with whom we coproduce knowledge.
    We overcome our limitations by actively seeking out diverse perspectives and challenging our preexisting assumptions.

!!! success "Open Science"
    We make our research accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional.
