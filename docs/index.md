## Mission Statement

Our mission is to support the social, environmental, and financial resilience of communities around the world by creatively informing the design and management of infrastructure systems.
Through mission-oriented basic research guided by community engagement, we develop tools and methods to accurately, transparently, and collaboratively link decisions, outcomes, and preferences.

## Core values

!!! success "Academic Freedom"
    As academics, we enjoy the luxury of having freedom to question the status quo and explore new ideas.
    It is our responsibility to imagine new possibilities and redefine engineering practice.

!!! success "Equity"
    We recognize the uncomfortable reality of systemic inequalities and seek to promote fairness, impartiality, and justice through our work.

!!! success "Excellence"
    We strive for excellence in all our activities and aim to be role models in all that we do.
    We seek to do what is right, not what is easy, and acknowledge when we fall short.

!!! success "Humility"
    Our work informs decisions that affect the real lives of real people, whose individual values and preferences we do not know.
    We understand the limitations of our expertise and celebrate the academic and community partners with whom we produce knowledge.
    We mitigate our own limitations by actively seeking out diverse perspectives and challenging our preexisting assumptions.

!!! success "Open Science"
    We make our research accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional.
