# Software Licenses

Software and other research materials that we make available to the public must declare a license for re-use.

All code generated in the lab should be open-source with a permissive (non-copyleft) license (MIT, BSD, or Apache).[^1]
If contributions to upstream copyleft projects are made, those contributions can be licensed in accordance with the upstream project license.

Importantly, in the lab we should cultivate an atmosphere of respect for licensing terms and ensuring that we are at all times in compliance with those terms.
