# Lab Presence

!!! info "Credit"
    Specific language on this page comes from the [Ocean Transport Group](https://ocean-transport.github.io/){:target="_blank"} at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the [MemoLab](https://github.com/memobc/memolab-manual){:target="_blank"} at Boston College.

## Lab presence

We work on issues of socially relevant problems, and it is expected that  lab members will work with a degree of seriousness commensurate with these challenges.
Working hard means:

* applying consistent, focused effort to your research in a serious, professional way
* working with a sense of urgency appropriate to the intellectual challenges we study and their real-world consequences
* [caring](../health/) for your physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional well-being
* sharing ideas and effort with lab members and collaborators

Working hard **does not mean**:

* putting in unreasonable or unsustainable hours
* competing to work the hardest or contributing to burnout culture

### Being present

One of the great advantages of working in academia is the flexible schedule.
However, this flexibility can also be a curse.
Here are some general guidelines to help define what it means to be "at work":

1. Full-time lab members should aim for a 40 hour work-week on average. Academic work often occurs in bursts -- sometimes you are happy and excited to work a 60 hour week as you are on the cusp of a major breakthrough. You should balance these periods of intensity with slower-paced weeks at another time.
1. Take at least one day per week (preferably two) completely off from your work and study.
1. Feel free to work remotely occasionally as it suits your personal and professional life.
1. Clearly delineate to yourself, your lab group, and your friends and family when you are really on vacation, as opposed to working remotely.
1. You are not expected to work on staff holidays. If you are being paid, then you are expected to work during university breaks (except for staff holidays or if you're taking your paid vacation/personal time).
1. Students and postdocs should take 4 weeks of vacation per year, which you should coordinate with James.
1. Respond to emails and group communications in a timely manner, typically within one business day.

## PI Availability

In addition to poking my head into the lab regularly, I (James) will be working on campus and available for meetings most days of the week.
If my door is open, feel free to pop in.
Because I am easily distracted, I ask that if my door is closed, send me a message or try me later rather than knock.
I’m also happy to set ad-hoc meetings to discuss anything over and above our weekly lab and individual meetings.

When working remotely, I’ll be similarly available over Slack and for ad-hoc meetings during regular office hours.
But I try to turn my notifications off when I’m going to be concentrating on something else for a long stretch.

Lab members should call my cell phone only for emergencies or time-sensitive needs (my recommendation letter is due in two hours and it still says you haven't submitted it; class started five minutes ago and you're not here; etc.)
