# Undergraduate Research

!!! info "Credit"
    Specific language on this page comes from the [MemoLab](https://github.com/memobc/memolab-manual){:target="_blank"} at Boston College.

## For Credit

If you want to work in lab and earn course credit, you can sign up for undergraduate research (discuss CEVE 499 with a program administrator or adviser).
We will have to fill out a syllabus contract at the beginning of the semester.
Typically you would be in lab for at least 10 hours a week, and you would also be required to attend lab meetings, read a few papers, and complete a few short written assignments.
You can enroll in undergraduate research multiple times, subject to the requirements of the University and your program.

## Senior Thesis

If you are interested in completing a senior thesis project, I recommend doing research for credit course during your sophomore or junior year.

## For Pay

If you want to work in lab and earn money, there are two different options.
The lab can pay you as a research assistant, typically 5-10 hours per week or as discussed.
We have a limited number of hours available each semester, so these positions are competitive.
Open positions may be posted on [our lab website](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/join-the-lab){:target="_blank"}, but if you have concrete ideas you can propose a project by applying as instructed on the website.

We can apply for an undergraduate research fellowship to fund your time in lab.
See the [Student Opportunity Center](https://ouri.rice.edu/student-opportunity-center){:target="_blank"} for information.
Because these fellowships are intended to support your academic development, undergraduate fellows will be required to participate in lab meetings.
This option is also available during the summer.
If you are interested in working in lab over the summer, talk to James about it as far in advance as you can.

If you have research funding from another source, let us know.

## Volunteer

Unpaid internships give an unfair advantage to those who can afford to volunteer their time and contribute to unequal representation in the field.
We do not take unpaid volunteers as research assistants in our lab, except for academic credit.
