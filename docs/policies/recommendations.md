# Recommendation Letters

!!! info "Credit"
    Specific language on this page comes from the [Peelle Lab](http://jpeelle.net/peellelab_manual.pdf){:target="_blank"} at Washington University in Saint Louis.

I (James) will write a letter for any student or lab member who has spent at least one year in the lab.
Letters will be provided for shorter-term lab members in exceptional circumstances (e.g., new graduate students or postdocs applying for fellowships).
I maintain this policy because I do not think that I can adequately evaluate someone who has been around for less than a year.

## How To

1. I expect at least two weeks of notice for letters of recommendation and request four. If you do not give me sufficient time, I may not be able to meet your deadline.
1. Send me your current CV and any relevant instructions for the contents of the letter.
1. If you are an undergraduate, I will write your letters on my own. For more senior lab members, I will also write your letters on my own, but please send me a draft of the letter (which I will extensively modify). The first fewtimes you do this it will probably feel awkward. However, keep in mind thatyour goal is to make it as easy as possible for a letter writer (in this case, me) to complete the task by the deadline and without error. Even though I will re-word a lot of the letter, it will still have the name of what you are applyingfor and details regarding how long I have known you, the projects you haveworked on, and so on. This is extremely helpful in jogging my memory and will give me more time to focus on saying good things bout you. The more specifics you can provide, the better. Don't worry that you are not being sufficiently humble; I have no problem toning things down if need be.
