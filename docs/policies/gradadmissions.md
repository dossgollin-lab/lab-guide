# Graduate Admissions

If you are unsure whether you would be a good fit, you can send me an email of interest.
Please see below for instructions (if you send me a generic email I probably won't respond!)

## Open Positions

When funding is available for M.S. and Ph.D students to do specific work, these positions will be advertised on the group’s ["Join"](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/join-the-lab) page.
When projects allow for a broader scope, or more general funding is available, that same page will note how many students the group is looking to take on.
If you have external funding **or a specific research idea**, you should reach out (see below) even if there's not a position posted.

## How to Apply

In order to join the group as a graduate student, you must apply to the program of your choice in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/phd-program).
See [Rice graduate admission guidelines](https://graduate.rice.edu/admissions/how-to-apply).
It is *your responsibility* to keep track of all required deadlines, materials, etc.

### Before formally applying

Applying to graduate school is a time-consuming and money-consuming process.
You are strongly encouraged (though not required) to reach out before formally applying.

1. Read relevant websites and [example papers](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/publications/) to judge whether this is a good fit. Note the kind of quantitative  research we do, the approaches we use, and the problems we analyze. Feel free to explore websites of coauthors and close collaborators.
1. Review the core values we adopt in the lab group and decide whether this is a good fit.
1. If you are interested and see a good fit, send an email to James ([jdossgollin@rice.edu](mailto:jdossgollin@rice.edu)) and
    1. DO: read the lab guide and lab website before you send an email.
    1. DO NOT: Ask a question that is answered in the FAQs below.
    1. DO: attach your current CV (as a .`pdf` file), a statement of your research interests or draft of your personal statement, and any relevant prior work you'd like me to look at.
    1. DO: explain why you are reaching out to me specifically.
    1. DO: ask specific questions
    1. We'll iterate via email. If this is of joint interest, we move to the next step (video-chats)
1. Video Chats
    1. These are intended to evaluate your verbal communications skills and how well you can articulate your interests. If a video chat does not work for you, we can find alternatives.
    1. There is no need for fancy backgrounds, formal presentations, or for dressing up.
    1. If this is of joint interest, you should apply formally to the department (see above)

### The formal application

Whether you have been in touch or not, you must apply to the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice (see above).
This will give the department an opportunity to view your transcripts, letters of recommendation, and personal statement.

Of these, the step you most control is the personal statement.
A good personal statement should clearly articulate:

1. How would joining this lab group advance your career and life goals?
1. What kind of project would you like to do?
1. How does your current skill-set map to the needs for the project?
1. Is James the right supervisor for you?
1. What synergies do you see with the group?

### After formally applying

If you have already been in touch, James will know to look for your application.
If your application suggests a good potential fit, we'll move on to the next step (guided paper evaluation).

If you have not yet been in touch, be sure to put James as the faculty with whom you want to work.
You may be invited to a brief video chat (see above) before proceeding to the guided paper evaluation.

1. Guided Paper Evaluation
    1. James will send you an email asking you to provide a written evaluation of a paper, which he will provide in that email. This paper will be selected based on your discussed interests. The goal of this response is to get a sense of your reading, writing, and critical thinking skills.
    1. Limit the evaluation to one page (12 point font) and address these questions:
        1. What are the main research questions and hypotheses of the paper?
        1. What are the key results?
        1. What are (potential) caveats?
        1. How would you improve on the paper?
    1. Please return your paper evaluation within seven days (if you think this will be a constraint, communicate this early)
1. If your paper evaluation suggests you have the required reading, writing, and critical thinking skills, we’ll move to the next step (you submitting a written application)
1. You meet the lab group and present your project idea
    1. Please keep this presentation short (12 min max)
    1. Feel free to reach out to other lab-group members and ask questions
    1. If this step suggests a good fit and we can work out the logistics, we move to the last step (you joining the lab group)
    1. You join the lab group and we start the work!

## Advice

There are three main questions that your application needs to answer.
Fundamentally, they're about making sure that if you join this group to do a PhD at Rice, you will be happy and successful.
PhD students who are happy and successful are PhD students in a program that is a good fit for their skills and interests!

1. Would doing this research advance *your* life/career goals?
1. Do you have the required training and ability to carry out this research? Have you given clear thought to the skills you will need to acquire and do you have a plan for how you will obtain them?
1. Is *James* the right supervisor for this research?

Although your application is assessed holistically, you should focus on crafting the personal statement to make sure that it clearly and obviously answers all three of these questions.

- [this MIT guide](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/cheme/commkit/graduate-school-personal-statement/) to the personal statement

### Advancing your goals

A PhD can be a long and tiring process.
Happy and successful PhD students are those who can draw energy and support from the big picture.
In your application, I'm looking to see:

- Have you thought clearly about your long-term goals? This doesn't have to be specific ("I want to work at a particular national lab") and you can express uncertainty ("I am interested in developing a startup and in academia, and this PhD will prepare me for both while helping me decide"). You should, of course, be interested in a career that involves research! I'm more interested in seeing evidence of a thoughtful process of discernment than in what your specific goals are. There isn't a "right" answer.
- Will the research projects I'm working on help you advance those goals? If your goal is to be an astronaut, this probably isn't a good fit.

### Background and training

PhD students aren't expected to hit the ground running -- some coursework and training is necessary -- but having a strong background will help you transition quickly to interesting research projects and minimize frustrations.
Strong applicants will have some exposure to the following skills, and will excel in at least one area.
No one's perfect at everything, though!

- *Writing and communication:* Science requires a great deal of reading, writing, and presenting. Clear communication is a critical skill, especially in the age of information overload. This doesn't mean that you need to be the next Amanda Gorman, and it doesn't mean that if English is your second language you can't thrive. However, you should use your personal statement (and share work you've finished) to demonstrate your writing abilities.
- *Programming:* All the work we do involves computation and simulation. In our group we use mainly Python, R, and Julia, but experience in other languages will serve you well. If you've never programmed, consider taking a free online class to demystify coding and to make sure that you will be happy spending hours every day writing and editing code.
- *Statistics, applied mathematics, and optimization:* We use quantitative tools to characterize uncertainty and inform decisions. If you have a solid background in probability or statistics, it will help you hit the ground running. Coursework or skills in statistics, probability, econometrics, optimization, applied mathematics, water resources management, and similar fields will strengthen your application.
- *Physical sciences:* Understanding climate risk and how it might change in the future requires some basic understanding of physical processes. A background in earth science, environmental science, environmental engineering, physics, hydrology, or similar fields will help you examine present and future hydroclimate hazard.
- *Critical thinking:* A Ph.D. is a license to do independent research, which means you should be able to formulate and examine research questions, not just turn the crank. You should be able to tell a story about why you posed a particular question, how your prior understanding of the area led you to formulate certain hypotheses, how you designed your experiment to test those hypotheses, and what the implications of the results are for your hypotheses in particular and the field in general. This skill is hard to demonstrate, but you can show your abilities in your personal statement and in any subsequent interviews.

If you are interested in our work but aren't sure whether you have a strong background, please reach out!
(In particular, studies show that individuals from minoritized groups tend to underestimate their own abilities. Please don't sell yourself short!)

## FAQ

### Should I write a research proposal?

You should include some research goals and ideas in your personal statement, but don't write a separate research proposal.
It's better to have a very strong personal statement than a less strong personal statement plus a research proposal.

### How is it the best way to find a master/Phd opportunity?

When you're applying to an undergraduate program, you care the most about the university.
When applying to a PhD (in engineering at least), you care the most about the research group you will be working with.

Start by thinking about what kind of research you want to do.
Do you like lab work or computational work?
What problems do you want to use?
What classes do you want to take?
Sketch out some research ideas that interest you.
Then, conduct a literature review and find out who is working in this space.
Look at their web pages and papers and look for research groups that appeal to you.

### What are normally the deadlines of the applications?

In general, programs in the US have a deadline in December or January for admission to the fall semester.
Some programs have a deadline in the fall for admission to the spring semester.
See [Rice graduate admission guidelines](https://graduate.rice.edu/admissions/how-to-apply) for our program's deadlines.
