# Graduate Admissions

If you are unsure whether you would be a good fit, you can send me an email of interest.
Please see below for instructions (if you send me a generic email I probably won't respond!)

You may also benefit from the wisdom of the internet.
For generic advice, check out:

- Matt Might's [How to Get Into Grad School](http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-apply-and-get-in-to-graduate-school-in-science-mathematics-engineering-or-computer-science/) post (note that this is aimed at computer science, but is overall similar)
- [this MIT guide](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/cheme/commkit/graduate-school-personal-statement/) to the personal statement
- [Rice University's guidance](https://graduate.rice.edu/news/grad-school-101-writing-personal-statement) to the personal statement

## Open Positions

When funding is available for M.S. and Ph.D students to do specific work, these positions will be advertised on the groupâ€™s ["Join"](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/join-the-lab) page.
When projects allow for a broader scope, or more general funding is available, that same page will note how many students the group is looking to take on.
If you have external funding or a specific research idea, you can reach out (see below) even if there's not a position posted.

## How to Apply

Apply to the program of your choice in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.rice.edu/academics/graduate-programs/phd-program).
See [Rice graduate admission guidelines](https://graduate.rice.edu/admissions/how-to-apply).
It is **your responsibility** to keep track of all required deadlines, materials, etc.

## What We're Looking For

There are three main questions that your application needs to answer.
Fundamentally, they're about making sure that if you join this group to do a PhD at Rice, you will be happy and successful.
PhD students who are happy and successful are PhD students in a program that is a good fit for their skills and interests!

1. Would doing this research advance *your* life/career goals?
1. Do you have the required training and ability to carry out this research? Have you given clear thought to the skills you will need to acquire and do you have a plan for how you will obtain them?
1. Am *I* the right supervisor for this research? Can the questions that you're interested in be answered using methods in which I have expertise?

Although your application is assessed holistically, you should focus on crafting the personal statement to make sure that it clearly and obviously answers all three of these questions.

### Advancing your goals

A PhD can be a long and tiring process.
Happy and successful PhD students are those who can draw energy and support from the big picture.
In your application, I'm looking to see:

- Have you thought clearly about your long-term goals? This doesn't have to be specific ("I want to work at a particular national lab") and you can express uncertainty ("I am interested in developing a startup and in academia, and this PhD will prepare me for both while helping me decide"). You should, of course, be interested in a career that involves research! I'm more interested in seeing evidence of a thoughtful process of discernment than in what your specific goals are. There isn't a "right" answer.
- Will the research projects I'm working on help you advance those goals? If your goal is to be an astronaut, this probably isn't a good fit.

### Background and training

PhD students aren't expected to hit the ground running -- some coursework and training is necessary -- but having a strong background will help you transition quickly to interesting research projects and minimize frustrations.
Strong applicants will have some exposure to the following skills, and will excel in at least one area.
No one's perfect at everything, though!

- **Writing and communication:** Science requires a great deal of reading, writing, and presenting. Clear communication is a critical skill, especially in the age of information overload. This doesn't mean that you need to be the next Amanda Gorman, and it doesn't mean that if English is your second language you can't thrive. However, you should use your personal statement (and share work you've finished) to demonstrate your writing abilities.
- **Programming:** All the work we do involves computation and simulation. In our group we use mainly Python, R, and Julia, but experience in other languages will serve you well. If you've never programmed, consider taking a free online class to demystify coding and to make sure that you will be happy spending hours every day writing and editing code.
- **Statistics, applied mathematics, and optimization:** We use quantitative tools to characterize uncertainty and inform decisions. If you have a solid background in probability or statistics, it will help you hit the ground running. Coursework or skills in statistics, probability, econometrics, optimization, applied mathematics, water resources management, and similar fields will strengthen your application.
- **Physical sciences:** Understanding climate risk and how it might change in the future requires some basic understanding of physical processes. A background in earth science, environmental science, environmental engineering, physics, hydrology, or similar fields will help you examine present and future hydroclimate hazard.
- **Critical thinking:** A Ph.D. is a license to do independent research, which means you should be able to formulate and examine research questions, not just turn the crank. You should be able to tell a story about why you posed a particular question, how your prior understanding of the area led you to formulate certain hypotheses, how you designed your experiment to test those hypotheses, and what the implications of the results are for your hypotheses in particular and the field in general. This skill is hard to demonstrate, but you can show your abilities in your personal statement and in any subsequent interviews.

If you are interested in our work but aren't sure whether you have a strong background, please reach out!
(In particular, studies show that individuals from minoritized groups tend to underestimate their own abilities. Please don't sell yourself short!)

### Adviser fit

"Fit" is a fluid concept that has often been used to justify implicit discrimination.
That's not what we're about!
However, it is important to consider whether

- Do your values align with ours?
- Is your preferred work style compatible with our guidelines?
- Will my expertise, as an adviser, and the projects we work on as a group advance your goals and satiate your intellectual curiousity?

## How To Send an Email Expressing Interest

Putting together all the materials for a graduate application is a lot of work for you and your recommenders, and it costs money.
If you are interested in applying but would like some feedback on whether you should apply, then:

- **DO**: read the lab guide and lab website before you send an email.
- **DO NOT**: Ask a question that is answered in the FAQs below.
- **DO**: attach your current CV (as a `.pdf`), a statement of your research interests or draft of your personal statement, and any relevant prior work you'd like me to look at.
- **DO**: explain why you are reaching out _to me specifically_.
- **DO**: ask for feedback on specific questions. For example, if you ask "are you still working on `<some topic>`"? or "do you have funding for students in the fall?" or "I'm very interested in using `<method related to what I work on>`; is this something you use?", then I can give you helpful feedback. If you ask "should I apply?" the answer will be "it's up to you." It would be unfair and unethical for me to try to conduct admissions outside the context of the actual application process.

## FAQ

### Should I write a research proposal?

The short answer: probably not.
You should include some research goals and ideas in your personal statement, and that should be enough.
It's better to have a very strong personal statement than a less strong personal statement plus a research proposal.

The longer answer: if you have a clear and specific research proposal that effectively supplements your personal statement, demonstrates a clear understanding of the field, and outlines feasible research for which I would be a suitable mentor, then a research proposal can help you.
However, since you are not expected to submit a research proposal, if you do submit one and it isn't strong, it could send a singal that you think you know more than you actually do.
In general you're better off improving your personal statement than writing a research proposal.

### How is it the best way to find a master/Phd opportunity?

When you're applying to an undergraduate program, you care the most about the university.
When applying to a PhD (in engineering at least), you care the most about the research group you will be working with.

Start by thinking about what kind of research you want to do.
Do you like lab work or computational work?
What problems do you want to use?
What classes do you want to take?
Sketch out some research ideas that interest you.
Then, conduct a literature review and find out who is working in this space.
Look at their web pages and papers and look for research groups that appeal to you.

### What are normally the deadlines of the applications?

In general, programs in the US have a deadline in December or January for admission to the fall semester.
Some programs have a deadline in the fall for admission to the spring semester.
See [Rice graduate admission guidelines](https://graduate.rice.edu/admissions/how-to-apply) for our program's deadlines.
