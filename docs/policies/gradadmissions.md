# Graduate Admissions

If you are unsure whether you would be a good fit, you can send me an email of interest.
Please see below for instructions.
You may also benefit from the wisdom of the internet.
For generic advice, check out:

- Matt Might's [How to Get Into Grad School](http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-apply-and-get-in-to-graduate-school-in-science-mathematics-engineering-or-computer-science/) post (note that this is aimed at computer science, but is overall similar)
- [this MIT guide](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/cheme/commkit/graduate-school-personal-statement/) to the personal statement
- [Rice University's guidance](https://graduate.rice.edu/news/grad-school-101-writing-personal-statement) to the personal statement

## How to Apply

Apply to the program of your choice in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.rice.edu/graduate-program).
See [Rice graduate admission guidelines](https://graduate.rice.edu/admissions/how-to-apply).
It is **your responsibility** to keep track of all required deadlines, materials, etc.

## What We're Looking For

There are three main questions that your application needs to answer.
Fundamentally, they're about making sure that if you join this group to do a PhD at Rice, you will be happy and successful.
PhD students who are happy and successful are PhD students in a program that is a good fit for their skills and interests!

1. Would doing this research advance *your* life/career goals?
1. Do you have the required training and ability to carry out this research? Have you given clear thought to the skills you will need to acquire and do you have a plan for how you will obtain them?
1. Am *I* the right supervisor for this research? Can the questions that you're interested in be answered using methods in which I have expertise?

Although your application is assessed holistically, you should focus on crafting the personal statement to make sure that it clearly and obviously answers all three of these questions.

## How To Send an Email Expressing Interest

Putting together all the materials for a graduate application is a lot of work for you and your recommenders, and it costs money.
If you are interested in applying but would like some feedback on whether you should

- **DO**: read the lab guide and lab website before you send an email.
- **DO NOT**: Ask a question that is answered in the FAQs below.
- **DO**: attach your current CV (as a `.pdf`), a statement of your research interests or draft of your personal statement, and any relevant prior work you'd like me to look at.
- **DO**: explain why you are reaching out _to me specifically_, whether that's a paper you read, a project you saw on the web site, or something else.
- **DO**: ask for feedback on specific questions. For example, if you ask "are you still working on `<some topic>`"? or "do you have funding for students in the fall?" or "I'm very interested in using `<method related to what I work on>`; is this something you use?", then I can give you helpful feedback. If you ask "should I apply?" the answer will be "it's up to you." It would be unfair and unethical for me to try to conduct admissions without reading your whole application and giving other faculty members the opportunity to read your application.

## FAQ

### Should I write a research proposal?

The short answer: probably not.
You should include some research goals and ideas in your personal statement, and that should be enough.
It's better to have a very strong personal statement than a less strong personal statement plus a research proposal.

The longer answer: if you have a clear and specific research proposal that effectively supplements your personal statement, demonstrates a clear understanding of the field, and outlines feasible research for which I would be a suitable mentor, then a research proposal can help you.
However, since you are not expected to submit a research proposal, if you do submit one and it isn't strong, it could send a singal that you think you know more than you actually do.
In general you're better off improving your personal statement than writing a research proposal.

### How is it the best way to find a master/Phd opportunity?

When you're applying to an undergraduate program, you care the most about the university.
When applying to a PhD (in engineering at least), you care the most about the research group you will be working with.

Start by thinking about what kind of research you want to do.
Do you like lab work or computational work?
What problems do you want to use?
What classes do you want to take?
Sketch out some research ideas that interest you.
Then, conduct a literature review and find out who is working in this space.
Look at their web pages and papers and look for research groups that appeal to you.

### What are normally the deadlines of the applications?

In general, programs in the US have a deadline in December or January for admission to the fall semester.
Some programs have a deadline in the fall for admission to the spring semester.
See [Rice graduate admission guidelines](https://graduate.rice.edu/admissions/how-to-apply) for our program's deadlines.
