# Writing and Style

Writing is one of the most difficult and most important scientific skills.
Sadly, a lot of academic (and governmental, consultant, etc) writing is horrible.
If people can't understand your work and why it matters to them, then it's very nearly useless.
More practically, clearer writing makes peer reviewers more likely to view you work favorably and readers more likely to cite it.
Fortunately, good academic writing doesn't have to be painful to write or read!

## Style

It is worth revisiting a good style guide regularly, such as:

> Williams, J. M., and J. Bizup. Style : Lessons in Clarity and Grace / Joseph M. Williams, Joseph Bizup. Twelfth edition. Boston: Pearson, 2017.

which gives ten principles for good writing:

1. Distinguish real grammatical rules from folklore
1. Use subjects to name the characters in your story
1. Use verbs to name their important actions
1. Open your sentences with familiar units of information
1. Get to the main verb quickly:
    1. Avoid long introductory phrases and clauses.
    1. Avoid long abstract subjects.
    1. Avoid interrupting the subject-verb connection.
1. Push new, complex units of information to the end of the sentence.
1. Begin sentences that form a unit with consistent subjects/topics.
1. Be concise:
    1. Cut meaningless and repeated words and obvious implications.
    1. Put the meaning of phrases into one or two words.
    1. Prefer affirmative sentences to negative ones.
1. Control sprawl:
    1. Don’t tack more than one subordinate clause onto another.
    1. Extend a sentence with resumptive, summative, and free modifiers.
    1. Extend a sentence with coordinate structures after verbs.
1. Above all, write to others as you would have others write to you.

Of course, science writing is unique in many ways.
A helpful resource is

> Schimel, J. (2012). Writing Science: How to Write Papers That Get Cited and Proposals That Get Funded. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press.

Digital copies of these books are available to group members.
We may sporadically organize ourselves to work through exercises in a book like Schimel (2012) in a group.

## Presentations

Matt Might gives [ten tips on academic talks](http://matt.might.net/articles/academic-presentation-tips/) (details in his blog post):

1. The audience determines the talk.
1. Practice almost makes perfect.
1. Nervous energy is exploitable.
1. Every talk should motivate a problem.
1. An academic talk is about an idea, not a paper.
1. Slides must not overwhelm the viewer.
1. Images and diagrams are better than text.
1. Math's benefit must outweigh the loss of attention.
1. Style matters.
1. Questions are not random.

## Practice Makes Perfect

Ultimately, good writing takes practice.
Many graduate students (and more senior researchers) are surprised by how long writing takes;[^lang] writing is an integral part of your scientific skillset and must not be neglected.
To improve the level of writing in the group:

* Be conscientious about improving your writing and strive towards clarity.
* Provide constructive feedback to other group members on writing when asked.
* Read well-written books, articles, and other non-scientific media for fun (this will remind you that writing needn't be dull and stuffy!)

[^lang]: It's bad enough for native English speakers! If English is not your first language, then be prepared for writing to feel slow and frustrating. Be patient with yourself -- being bilingual is a superpower, and superpowers don't develop overnight!

## Toolkit

We use a writing toolkit that reflects our [open science](../expectations/open.md) mission.
Specifically:

* we make our writing open to the public and the scientific community by the time our work is published
* we use [version control](../coding/git.md){:target="_blank"} to track changes and contribution
* we use plain text tools (like [Markdown](../coding/markdown.md) or [LaTeX](../coding/latex.md)) that work with version control and that do not require specialized software.[^dealerschoice][^accessible]

[^dealerschoice]: Many collaborators use Google Docs or Microsoft Word; in these cases the convention is for the first author to choose the toolkit.
[^accessible]: If coauthors need accessibility features available only in a specific software, then we always prioritize inclusivity over dogmatic choice of software!
