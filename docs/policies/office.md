# Ryon B28 Space

Lab members have access to shared workspace in Ryon B28.
Once renovations are complete and work from home instructions are lifted, users of this space will develop guidelines around noise, food, shared equipment, etc. to be shared here.

## Conference Room

Anyone can view room availability [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19oMmdlZThtdmdiOXVjODMzM2UyYnUzZm82c0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).
However, only approved group members can book the space.

To book the conference room:

1. Make sure your Rice University email has been added to the B28 Calendar. You can check that you are added by going to the calendar link above and making sure that you can see event details, rather than just whether the space is busy/available.
1. create a Google Calendar event and add `c_h2gee8mvgb9uc8333e2bu3fo6s@group.calendar.google.com`. If your event does not conflict with an existing reservation, it will be automatically accepted.
1. James reserves the right to override existing space reservations as needed.
