title: "Harassment Policy"
---

This policy represents our commitment to building an inclusive, diverse, and equitable environment. We celebrate the diverse experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds of our group members, colleagues, and broader community, recognizing that this diversity strengthens our research, fosters innovation, and enhances our collective growth. All members of the research group must abide by and collectively enforce these guidelines.

## The quick version

Our research group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of personal characteristics or background. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Professional conduct is expected in all settings, including online interactions. Violations may result in sanctions or expulsion from the group.

## The less quick version

All Rice employees and students must understand and comply with the University's policies and procedures regarding harassment and discrimination, including but not limited to the [Policy on Harassment and Sexual Misconduct](https://policy.rice.edu/830) and the [Prohibited Behaviors](https://safe.rice.edu/prohibited-behaviors). Our group adopts additional guidelines.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to personal characteristics
- Unwelcome sexual attention or imagery
- Intimidation or stalking
- Disruption of the research environment
- Inappropriate physical contact

If you experience or witness harassment, please contact James Doss-Gollin immediately. James can assist with security, law enforcement, or official University reporting channels. Please note that James is a mandatory reporter as defined in [University Policy](https://policy.rice.edu/828). For concerns about James, or if you prefer he not be involved, contact the [Office for Interpersonal Misconduct Prevention and Support](https://safe.rice.edu/getting-help-friend-and-yourself), [Office of Diversity and Inclusion](https://dei.rice.edu/), or [Title IX Office](https://titleix.rice.edu/).

We expect professional, respectful behavior in all work-related settings, including conferences and social events.

## Additional Notes

- Cultural sensitivity: We recognize that cultural norms vary, but within our group, these standards apply to all members regardless of background. We actively encourage open dialogue, seek opportunities to learn from one another, and strive to create an environment where all members feel welcomed, respected, and supported.
- Taking concerns seriously: If someone asks you to stop a behavior that is bothering them, take their request seriously and stop the behavior immediately, even if you don't understand why it's problematic.
- Regular review: This policy will be reviewed annually to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

By joining this research group, you agree to uphold these standards and contribute to a harassment-free environment that values and celebrates the diversity within our community.
