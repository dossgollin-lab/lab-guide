## Everyone

1. **Environment:** Foster a supportive team environment committed to mutual learning and success. Support and help your labmates. Read and follow lab guidelines, suggesting improvements when you see opportunities. Take initiative in your work and in advancing the lab's mission.
2. **Workload:** Treat your research as a full-time job, aiming for an average of 40 hours per week. This approach ensures consistent progress while allowing you to benefit from the flexibility academic research offers.
3. **Presence:** Be an active participant in the lab. Attend and contribute to group meetings and seminars, taking turns to lead discussions. Be present in the lab during agreed times and respect shared spaces.
4. **Open Science:** Adhere to our [Open Science](../guides/open-science.qmd) guidelines to ensure our work is accessible and reproducible.
5. **Manage Up:** Take responsibility for your relationship with your advisor(s). Schedule and lead regular 1:1 meetings, preparing agendas and following up on action items. Communicate your needs, goals, and challenges clearly. Seek feedback proactively, propose solutions rather than just problems, and provide respectful feedback on your working relationship.

### Health and Well-being

Academia can be stressful, and it's important to take care of yourself.

1. Maintain a healthy sleep schedule.
2. Pursue interests and hobbies outside of work to relieve stress and stimulate creative thought.
3. Develop a support network among your peers who understand the challenges.
4. Use mental health resources when needed. Seeking help is a worthy investment in yourself.
5. Stay home when sick to protect your health and that of others.
6. Use Rice's mental health resources:
   - [Wellbeing and Counseling Center](https://wellbeing.rice.edu/studentwellbeing)
   - [Counseling Center](https://wellbeing.rice.edu/counseling-center/about-us)

Remember, no project, paper, grant, or collaboration is more important than your well-being.

## Specific Responsibilities

We all have different roles and responsibilities in the lab.
Here are some guidelines based on your role.

### PI

2. **Define Research Directions:** Identify socially relevant and scientifically novel research questions, leveraging field awareness, creativity, and insight.
3. **Provide Technical Leadership:** Establish a software and hardware environment that maximizes productivity for all team members.
4. **Scientific Mentoring:** Guide junior members in developing into independent scientists through regular meetings, feedback, and strategic planning.
5. **Manage Publication Process:** Assist in identifying publishable results, selecting appropriate journals, and navigating the revision process.
6. **Secure Funding:** Obtain grant funding to support the group's research and ensure coverage of all research-related expenses.
7. **Academic Service:** Fulfill departmental duties, teach courses, and participate in professional organizations. Serve on student committees and review papers and proposals.
8. **Provide Comprehensive Feedback:** Offer guidance on all aspects of research, from hypothesis formation to data management and paper writing.
9. **Offer Support:** Provide moral support, career advice, and recommendation letters to help members navigate the challenges of research and academic life.
10. **Project Management:** Help structure projects with clear goals, milestones, and timelines, balancing guidance with fostering independence.

### Graduate Students

1. **Apply for External Funding:** This is required and provides valuable experience. We maintain a list of opportunities on Slack.
2. **Be Professional and Organized:** Develop a system for managing responsibilities, coursework, and research.
4. **Develop Independence:** Pursue your own ideas, attend diverse talks, read widely, and take initiative in your research.
5. **Focus on Research:** Prioritize research over other duties, approaching it with full-time job seriousness.
6. **Stay in Good Standing:** Understand and fulfill all graduate school and department requirements and deadlines.
7. **Career Planning:** Reflect on your career goals and work with James to get necessary training and exposure.
9. **Balance Independence and Guidance:** Learn to strike a balance between working independently and seeking help when needed. Don't hesitate to ask for assistance, but always come prepared with your thoughts and potential solutions.
10. **Professional Development:** Take charge of your own professional development. Seek out opportunities for skill-building, networking, and career exploration beyond what's directly offered in the lab.
