Please see below for instructions (if you send me a generic email I probably won't respond!) Open Positions \u00b6 When funding is available for M.S. and Ph.D students to do specific work, these positions will be advertised on the group\u2019s \"Join Us\" page. When projects allow for a broader scope, or more general funding is available, that same page will note how many students the group is looking to take on. If you have external funding or a specific research idea, you should reach out (see below) even if there's not a position posted. How to apply \u00b6 In order to join the group as a graduate student, you must apply to the program of your choice in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering . See Rice graduate admission guidelines . It is your responsibility to keep track of all required deadlines, materials, etc! Before formally applying \u00b6 Applying to graduate school is a time- and money-consuming process. You are strongly encouraged (though not required ) to reach out before formally applying as this can help to give both of us a sense of whether it's worth the investment of your time to apply. To reach out, please read the instructions below and then fill out this form . If you send me an email, you will get a template email directing you to fill out the form. I get too many emails from prospective students to keep track of all of them effectively. 1. Decide if you are interested Read relevant websites and example papers to judge whether this is a good fit. Note the kind of quantitative research we do, the approaches we use, and the problems we analyze. Feel free to explore websites of coauthors and close collaborators. Review the core values we adopt in the lab group (described int his document) and decide whether they are compatible with your values and goals. 2. Fill out the form If you are still interested and see the potential for a good fit, fill out the form for prospective applicants . This form asks for a statement of purpose. See \"how to write a good application\" for some helpful tips on how to write a good one! Statements that do not follow these tips are unlikely to stand out and will probably not lead to you being accepted. Fill out all requested questions thoughtfully. I suggest to draft text inputs in another application so that if your internet connection is disrupted nothing is lost. I will follow up via email. 3. Video chats These are intended to evaluate your verbal communications skills and how well you can articulate your interests. If a video chat does not work for you, we can find alternatives. There is no need for fancy backgrounds, formal presentations, or for dressing up. If this is of joint interest, you should apply formally to the department (see next) The formal application \u00b6 Whether you have been in touch or not, you must apply to the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice . This will give the department an opportunity to view your transcripts, letters of recommendation, and statement of purpose. Of these, the step you most control is the statement of purpose; see below for tips on information on how to write a strong statement of purpose that enhances your chances of admission. After formally applying \u00b6 1. Guided paper evaluation If your application suggests a good potential fit, we'll move on to the next step. James will send you an email asking you to provide a written evaluation of a research paper, which will be selected based on your discussed interests. The goal of this evaluation is to get a sense of your reading, writing, and critical thinking skills. Limit the evaluation to three page (12 point font) and address these questions: What are the main research questions and hypotheses of the paper? What are the key results? What are (potential) caveats? How would you improve on the paper? This evaluation is governed by the Rice Honor Policy . Please briefly review this document and include the pledge(\"On my honor, I have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid on this assignment\"). You should do this work on your own, without communicating with advisors, colleagues, etc. You may use information on the web -- not only bibliographic search tools but also Wikipedia, PubPeer, Hypothesis, etc. However, you must attribute your sources. Please use a formal bibliographic style such as APA, AGU, or similar for citing scholarly works. You may reference web sites and other materials using endnotes. References do not count toward the page limit. You may use large language models (e.g., ChatGPT) to help you write your evaluation. However, you should be prepared to answer detailed questions about what you have written and to explain your reasoning, which will be hard if you haven't read the paper carefully. You must also cite the model you used. Please return your paper evaluation within seven days (if you think this will be a constraint, communicate this ahead of time and we can give additional time) 2. Formal interview If your guided paper evaluation suggests you have the critical reading and writing skills to succeed in the program, we'll move on to the next step. The goal of this interview is to get a sense of your communication skills and to follow up on your application. Please prepare a 12-15 minute presentation summarizing the guided paper evaluation that you submitted. James will ask you follow up questions about the guided paper evaluation. James will ask you follow up questions about a research project you have worked on. James will ask you some general questions about your academic and professional goals. You will have time to ask James any questions that you have. 3. Meet the group If your interview suggests you would be likely be a good fit for our group, we will move to the next step: you meeting the group. The goal of this visit is to get a sense of how you would interact with current group members and to hear you articulate your research interests and goals. This visit may be in-person or remotely, depending on travel logistics Please prepare a short presentation for the group about a research idea. This should cover research you want to do , not research you have already done. Feel free to reach out to other lab-group members or collaborators to ask questions! 4. Join the group If your meeting suggests a good fit, we move to the last step: you joining the group. You will be formally admitted to the Rice Ph.D. program. You join the lab group and we start doing exciting work! How to write a good application \u00b6 Although your application is assessed holistically, you should focus on crafting the statement of purpose to make sure that it clearly and obviously answers all three of these questions. A good statement of purpose should clearly articulate: How would joining this lab group advance your career and life goals? What kind of research would you like to carry out in your Ph.D.? How does your current skill-set map to the needs for the project? What will you need to learn? Why is James the right supervisor for you to carry out this research? What synergies do you see with the group? If your statement of purpose does not directly address these questions, it is unlikely to stand out and will decrease your chances of being accepted. For some additional generic advice, check out the following resources: Matt Might's How to Get Into Grad School post (note that this is aimed at computer science, but is overall similar) this MIT guide to the statement of purpose Rice University's guidance to the statement of purpose Chris Blattman's Twitter Thread and blog post on writing a strong statement of purpose (tailored to economics and social sciences, but the advice is highly applicable!) FAQ \u00b6 Are positions fully funded? In short: yes. All Ph.D. positions within the group will be fully funded. That includes tuition support, a stipend, and other benefits -- see Rice's 2022 Announcement . You will get more details in your formal offer letter if accepted. Should I write a research proposal? You should include some research goals and ideas in your statement of purpose, but don't write a separate research proposal. See the advice listed above for more details. How is it the best way to find a master/Phd opportunity? When you're applying to an undergraduate program, you care the most about the university. When applying to a PhD (in engineering at least), you care the most about the research group you will be working with. Start by thinking about what kind of research you want to do. Do you like lab work or computational work? What problems do you want to use? What classes do you want to take? Sketch out some research ideas that interest you. Then, conduct a literature review and find out who is working in this space. Look at their web pages and papers and look for research groups that appeal to you. How often do students usually travel for conferences? After the first year (primarily classes) I aim to fund students to go to the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting (1 week in December) or the American Society of Civil Engineers Environment / Water Resources Institute annual meeting (1 week in May). There are also lots of smaller and more targeted workshops that are often great experiences -- they often have some student travel grants and with planning we can often fund student travel. What are things you wish more students knew before joining your program? I got some feedback from current students for this. Balancing course requirements (roughly 6 courses -- see student handbook for details) and research can be a challenge, especially for first-year graduate students who generally have the heaviest courseloads. For anyone doing modeling or data-driven work, most of your day will be spent (i) reading, (ii) writing, or (iii) coding. You should strive to improve your effectiveness in all three areas and plan to spend much of your day at a computer (which also means being deliberate about getting out of your computer!) You will get more out of grad school (this applies to any program!) if you have a clear idea of what you want to learn and what you want to get out of grad school. What is the worst quality of life pain point that your students go through? I got some feedback from current students for this. Trying to learn how to do research while also taking a heavy courseload can make for a tough first semester (this was also my experience). How has the lab planned and handled for student's growth throughout their graduate program? I got some feedback from current students for this. We're still figuring this out and will continue to adapt as we learn more. Students learn best from each other, so we have regular reading groups, where we meet (often with friends from other groups) to discuss papers. We help each other prepare for conferences, give each other feedback on papers, etc. This only works in an environment where we trust each other (both giving and getting feedback require trust) so we need to hold ourselves and each other to a high standard of integrity (i.e., be trustworthy!) As a young / small group, it's also important to have interaction with people outside the group -- we have meetings and social events with other lab groups, and most students are working on collaborative projects that include people from beyond our group. How are publication credits discussed in the lab? Please see authorship . Journals typically have clear expectations about what constitutes authorship and we follow those guidelines. The most important rule is to have clear conversations about authorship early on (this is the PI's responsibility but students are always welcome to ask about authorship!) How has the lab dealt with academic and social misconduct situations (plagiarism, bullying, harassment, misogyny, racism, transphobia, etc)? So far we've been fortunate to have avoided significant academic and social misconduct. We obviously follow Rice University policies. We've also developed a policy on harassment and other expectations that will guide us if (when) these come up. In general we set high expectations for ourselves and for one another because a collaborative and open environment, which benefits everyone, requires mutual trust and respect.","title":"Graduate Admissions"},{"location":"admissions/gradadmissions/#graduate-admissions","text":"If you are unsure whether you would be a good fit, you can send me an email of interest.

Openings and Applying \u00b6 There are three main ways to do research as an undergraduate: For credit As a senior thesis For pay Please see the lab website's \"Join Us\" page for advertised positions, although you're always welcome to reach out if you have a specific idea (see below). Specific positions for pay may be also advertised as announcements on the lab website . Research for Credit \u00b6 If you want to work in lab and earn course credit, you can sign up for undergraduate research (discuss CEVE 499 with a program administrator or adviser). We will have to fill out a syllabus contract at the beginning of the semester. Typically you would be in lab for at least 10 hours a week, and you would also be required to attend lab meetings, read a few papers, and complete a few short written assignments. You can enroll in undergraduate research multiple times, subject to the requirements of the University and your degree. To Apply : send me an email from your Rice University account: Put \"CEVE 499: Research for Credit\" in the subject line of the email, Attach your CV or resume (short is fine, undergrads don't need a 5 page CV!) as a .pdf file Attach a 1-2 page project proposal. The more detailed, the better (see below) as a .pdf file Suggest some times when you might be available to talk further in the body of the email. Senior Thesis Supervision \u00b6 If you are interested in having me supervise your senior thesis project, I recommend doing research for credit course during your sophomore or junior year. However, this is not a strict requirement (especially in 2021 since I'm new here!!) To Apply : as above (to do research for credit) but put \"Senior Thesis Supervision\" in the subject line of the email. Research for Pay \u00b6 If you want to work in lab and earn money, there are two different options. The lab can pay you as a research assistant, typically 5-10 hours per week at $12 per hour or as discussed. We have a limited number of hours available each semester, so these positions are competitive. Open positions may be posted on our lab website , but if you have concrete ideas you can propose a project (see below). We can apply for an undergraduate research fellowship to fund your time in lab. Because these fellowships are intended to support your academic development, undergraduate fellows will be required to participate in lab meetings. This option is also available during the summer. To Apply : as above (to do research for credit) but put \"Research for Pay\" in the subject line of the email. Volunteer Research \u00b6 Unpaid internships give an unfair advantage to those who can afford to volunteer their time and contribute to unequal representation in the field. We do not take unpaid volunteers as research assistants in our lab, except for academic credit. How To \u00b6 Write a Project Proposal \u00b6 A project proposal is a first draft of a semester research plan that we will craft together. This document will lay out research questions, research goals, research milestones and timelines, the tools you will need to carry out the research, and the mentoring and guidance you will need. As you write the first draft, your main goal is to convince me that you've thought about what research you want to do, that this research serves some intellectual or career goals that you have, that you have most of the skills you will need to do it, and that it's something that I would be well suited to supervise. Some things that I'm looking for when reading a project proposal are: Is the research feasible? (Do you have the skills needed? Do I have the resources needed?) Is the research interesting? Do you have a sense of previous work in this area? Are there social, policy, or technical implications? Are you going to be motivated? Does this advance real goals that you have? Am I the right mentor for this work? Do I have the skills and resources needed to support you? Does this research advance my goals? 1 FAQ \u00b6 If you email me with a question, I may ask your permission to post that question and answer (with anonymity) on this section. This can help future prospective students. This one is a bit trickier, since you don't necessarily know my goals! However, if your research is tied to projects I'm working on or have worked on in the past, or if it's related to something we've talked about in the past, there's a good chance that it advances my goals. Don't get too stressed about this part. \u21a9","title":"Undergraduate Research"},{"location":"admissions/undergrad/#undergraduate-research","text":"Credit Specific language on this page comes from the MemoLab at Boston College.","title":"Undergraduate Research"},{"location":"admissions/undergrad/#openings-and-applying","text":"There are three main ways to do research as an undergraduate: For credit As a senior thesis For pay Please see the lab website's \"Join Us\" page for advertised positions, although you're always welcome to reach out if you have a specific idea (see below).

Some things that I'm looking for when reading a project proposal are: Is the research feasible? (Do you have the skills needed? Do I have the resources needed?) Is the research interesting? Do you have a sense of previous work in this area? Are there social, policy, or technical implications? Are you going to be motivated? Does this advance real goals that you have?

Roles and responsibilities \u00b6 Contribute This is intended to be a living document and remains a work in progress. These expectations are negotiable; we can revise them before you join the lab and while you are here. Everyone \u00b6 Do work that you are proud of. Do work that others will care about. If you feel as though your work does not meet these standards, speak up Double-check your work. Being a little obsessive is essential to good science. Be supportive of your labmates. We are a team. Work independently when you can, ask for help when you need it. Share your knowledge. Exchanging knowledge and skills with your peers is the core of academic research. Respect each others' strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs. Academia may feel different from other types of jobs, but it is still a job. You should treat coming into lab with the same respect that you would treat any other position. Communicate openly and respectfully with other members of the lab. If you have an issue with another lab member that cannot be solved by talking with them about it, please talk with James. If you have an issue with James, please reach out to another member of the department or the school of engineering. PI responsibilities \u00b6 As the group leader, James has a unique and challenging range of responsibilities. Build an Inclusive Environment: the PI is responsible for managing the social dynamic of the lab group to create a welcoming, inclusive, and productive environment. Define Research Directions for the Group: Finding research questions that are socially relevant and scientifically novel is one of the hardest and most important components of basic applied research. It requires an awareness of the overall state of knowledge in the field, creativity, and plenty of luck. Define the Technical Approach: Software and computing are very important to our group. The PI is working hard to provide a software and hardware environment that enables everyone else to be as productive as possible. Departmental Service: The PI has lots of responsibilities to the department, including attending department meetings, participating in committees, and serving on student masters meetings / qualifying exams / thesis proposals / thesis defenses. Provide Scientific Mentoring: It is the PI\u2019s responsibility to help the junior members in the group develop into mature, independent scientists, capable of defining and executing their own research programs. Lab members will meet annually to sketch a strategic plan for the academic year and regularly (for now, weekly) to stay in touch. Manage the Publication Process: Published papers are the main output of our team. The PI can help identify when results are ready to publish, select which journals to target, and help manage the ups and downs of the revision process. Obtain Funding: Scientific research is expensive! A central role of the PI is to obtain grant funding to support our work, without which no research could happen. Professional Service: The PI is expected to participate in professional organizations (e.g. AGU, AMS) and review papers and proposals on an ongoing basis. Provide Feedback: The PI is expected to provide feedback on all aspects of research, including defining hypotheses and formulating questions; identifying specific methods and technical approaches; identifying relevant datasets; writing and debugging scientific code; producing figures and visualizations; managing data; and writing and editing papers. Feedback is also available on course selection, overall career goals, and long-term strategy. Provide Material Support: You are never expected to spend any of your personal finances on anything related to research. All conference travel, computer supplies, books, etc. can be paid for with grant support (see item 2 above). Coordinate these expenses, in advance, with James. Provide Moral Support: Graduate school, and research in general, can be an emotional roller coaster. James has been through these challenges personally and is always available to listen and provide advice (though you should also see the Health Resources page). Provide Recommendation Letters: You need them for almost every career move. Set Goals and Timelines: The PI can help give structure to your project by defining specific milestones and timelines for their completion. Some people prefer to be closely managed in this way, while others may prefer a more hands-off approach. Sign Stuff: There are lots of signatures needed to navigate the bureaucracy. Teach Classes: The PI\u2019s main job is to teach at least one course for semester, which occupies a large fraction of available time and effort. Grad Student Responsibilities \u00b6 Heads up You shouldn't spend your own money on necessary work supplies. Talk to James to make sure you have the resources you need. Graduate students are both students and workers, leading to a complex range of responsibilities to manage. Ask Questions! If something is unclear to you -\u2013 either a science question or a procedural / administrative issue -\u2013 you should speak up. Develop Dissertation Research. Ideally, your dissertation research will consist of at least 3 experiments that can be packaged into one thesis document. Apply for External Funding. Applying to external funding (e.g., NSF GRFP) that you are eligible for is required of our graduate students, but even if it wasn\u2019t, I would recommend it because it is such a valuable learning experience. Be Professional and Organized: Develop a system that works for your for managing your responsibilities, coursework, and research. This is one of the biggest challenges of graduate school and there is no formula that works for everyone. Communicate with the group and attend group meetings. Develop a Research Plan: In consultation with your advisor, you should come up with a long-term plan for your research, with clearly defined milestones and goals. Each week, you should have a short term plan for exactly what to work on to move towards those goals. Develop Independence: Your goal is to become an independent scientist. This means you should not hesitate to pursue your own ideas as they arise. Go to as many talks as you can to learn new things! Read (and re-read) papers in your field and outside it. Download that dataset and analyze it! Run that new model! Don\u2019t wait to be told to do things. Take the initiative. Focus on your Research: Your research is the most important part of your grad school experience. It should be your main priority, and you should approach it with the seriousness and professionalism you would a full-time job. It is easy to get caught up in coursework or TA-ing, but at the end of 5-ish years, you need to have completed a dissertation. Produce Reusable Data / Software: In our group, we believe strongly that research is more than just papers. You are expected to share the outputs of your research (data and software) in a way that makes them reusable by the rest of the group and the rest of the field. See Open Science . Stay in Good Standing: it is YOUR responsibility to understand all of the formal requirements of the graduate school and the department, and to stay ahead of all deadlines regarding registration, paperwork, qualifying exams, committee meetings, etc. Stay on Top of your Coursework: The beginning of grad school is dominated by classes. You should strive to get as much as possible out of your coursework and connect it to your research wherever possible. Do Some Soul-Searching: it is your responsibility to think about what type of career you want to pursue (e.g., academic jobs that are research-focused or teaching-focused, non-academic jobs like data science or science writing). We can brainstorm ways of making sure you are getting the training that you need and exposure to paths that you may be interested in. Undergraduate Responsibilities \u00b6 Undergraduate students in the research group have a few core responsibilities. Learn Participate Meet college requirements Maintain average working rate of 10hrs/wk (unless otherwise discussed) Track time spent working honestly and accurately Plan for the future Explore many paths Submit weekly reports Attend lab meetings when possible Apply for scholarships, awards, and fellowships Be helpful, friendly, and open to new ideas","title":"Expectations and Responsibilities"},{"location":"expectations/expectations/#expectations-and-responsibilities","text":"Caveat Guidelines from Rice University, Rice Engineering, and Rice CEE take precedence over this section.

Lab presence \u00b6 We work on issues of socially relevant problems, and it is expected that lab members will work with a degree of seriousness commensurate with these challenges. Working hard means: applying consistent, focused effort to your research in a serious, professional way working with a sense of urgency appropriate to the intellectual challenges we study and their real-world consequences caring for your physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional well-being sharing ideas and effort with lab members and collaborators Working hard does not mean : putting in unreasonable or unsustainable hours competing to work the hardest or contributing to burnout culture Being present \u00b6 One of the great advantages of working in academia is the flexible schedule. However, this flexibility can also be a curse. Here are some general guidelines to help define what it means to be \"at work\": Full-time lab members should aim for a 40 hour work-week on average. Academic work often occurs in bursts -- sometimes you are happy and excited to work a 60 hour week as you are on the cusp of a major breakthrough. You should balance these periods of intensity with slower-paced weeks at another time. Take at least one day per week (preferably two) completely off from your work and study. Feel free to work remotely occasionally as it suits your personal and professional life. Clearly delineate to yourself, your lab group, and your friends and family when you are really on vacation, as opposed to working remotely. You are not expected to work on staff holidays. If you are being paid, then you are expected to work during university breaks (except for staff holidays or if you're taking your paid vacation/personal time). Students and postdocs should take 4 weeks of vacation per year, which you should coordinate with James. Respond to emails and group communications in a timely manner, typically within one business day. PI Availability \u00b6 In addition to poking my head into the lab regularly, I (James) will be working on campus and available for meetings most days of the week. If my door is open, feel free to pop in. Because I am easily distracted, I ask that if my door is closed, send me a message or try me later rather than knock. I\u2019m also happy to set ad-hoc meetings to discuss anything over and above our weekly lab and individual meetings. When working remotely, I\u2019ll be similarly available over Slack and for ad-hoc meetings during regular office hours.

However, this flexibility can also be a curse. Here are some general guidelines to help define what it means to be \"at work\": Full-time lab members should aim for a 40 hour work-week on average. Academic work often occurs in bursts -- sometimes you are happy and excited to work a 60 hour week as you are on the cusp of a major breakthrough. You should balance these periods of intensity with slower-paced weeks at another time. Take at least one day per week (preferably two) completely off from your work and study. Feel free to work remotely occasionally as it suits your personal and professional life. Clearly delineate to yourself, your lab group, and your friends and family when you are really on vacation, as opposed to working remotely. You are not expected to work on staff holidays. If you are being paid, then you are expected to work during university breaks (except for staff holidays or if you're taking your paid vacation/personal time). Students and postdocs should take 4 weeks of vacation per year, which you should coordinate with James.

General Guidelines \u00b6 A good general reference for authorship is given by the American Geophysical Union guidelines , which state that authors are expected to do the following to contribute the highest quality science to AGU publications: Present a precise and accurate account of the research performed and a clear, objective discussion of its significance. Include sufficient detail and reference to sources of information in a manuscript to permit the author\u2019s peers to repeat the work. Limitations on use of or access to data must be clearly identified. Identify sources of all information and cite those publications that have been influential in determining the nature of the reported work and that guide the reader quickly to the primary and other earlier work essential for understanding the present investigation. Information obtained privately, as in conversation or correspondence, should not be used or reported without explicit permission from the source. Carefully document methodology, assumptions, and uncertainty. 1 Follow the appropriate procedures in force in their countries that govern the ethics of work done with human or animal subjects. Never plagiarize the work or ideas of others or your own work. Always provide appropriate citation. [The AGU provides further information on plagiarism, which you should read.] Avoid unnecessary fragmentation or redundant publication of research reports to artificially increase the number of publications. Never include personal criticism in a written piece of work. Report to the editor any changes made to the manuscript after acceptance. Include as coauthors only those persons who have made significant scientific contributions to the work and determine order of authorship in a manner appropriate to the contribution. 2 All coauthors share responsibility for the quality and integrity of the submitted and published manuscript. Reveal to the editor any potential conflict of interest for any author that might be affected by publication of the results contained in a manuscript or in the development of the research. List all funding sources and sources of data or other in-kind support for all authors in the acknowledgments. In the role of corresponding author, ensure that all coauthors are fully cognizant of the steps and changes in the manuscript during the peer review process.

Paper Contract \u00b6 To facilitate conversations about authorship, contribution, and research design, we write paper contracts early in the research design process. Paper contracts lay out the paper's research questions, hypotheses, broad methodology, author line, submission plan, and author contributions.

In general, the work should be \"new\" in that it has not been presented previously, and it should be appropriate for the conference. This will usually result in one conference per year. If you wish to attend any other conference outside of these guidelines, the lab may be willing to reimburse you for the registration fee.
